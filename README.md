# Final_Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify philosophical texts with its author using Natural Language Processing. 

## Steps 

1. State the objective. 
2. Define the authors and look for the text. 
    * 2.1. Convert them to txt file. 
3. Clean de text files. 
    * 3.1. Remove prologues, indexes, appendices and bibliography. 
    * 3.2. Keep only the author's text. 
    * 3.3. Eliminate rare symbols. 
4. Natural Language processing. 
    * 4.1. Tokenize the text. 
    * 4.2. Lemmatize the text. 
    * 4.3. Create a dictionary with the unique set of words from the texts. 
    * 4.4. Create a Bag of Words. 
5. Building the model for classifying. 
    * 5.1. Build a multinomial Logistic Regression. 
    * 5.1.1. Check the parameters and accuracy and adjust. 
    * 5.2. Build a Recurrent Neural Network. 
    * 5.2.1. Check the parameters and accuracy and adjust. 
6. Conclusions.
