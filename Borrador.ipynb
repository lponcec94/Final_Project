       "' the apology of socrates.   i know not  o athenians! how far you have been influenced by my accusers for my part  in listening to them i almost forgot myself  so plausible were their arguments however  so to speak  they have said nothing true. but of the many falsehoods which they uttered i wondered at one of them especially  that in which they said that you ought to be on your guard lest you should be deceived by me  as being eloquent in speech. for that they are not ashamed of being forthwith convicted by me in fact  when i shall show that i am not by any means eloquent  this seemed to me the most shameless thing in them  unless indeed they call him eloquent who speaks the truth. for  if they mean this  then i would allow that i am an orator  but not after their fashion for they  as i affirm  have said nothing true  but from me you shall hear the whole truth. not indeed  athenians  arguments highly wrought  as theirs were  with choice phrases and expressions  nor adorned  but you shall hear a speech uttered without premeditation in such words as first present themselves. for i am confident that what i say will be just  and let none of you expect otherwise  for surely it would not become my time of life to come before you like a youth with a got up speech. above all things  therefore  i beg and implore this of you  o athenians! if you hear me defending myself in the same language as that in which i am accustomed to speak both in the forum at the counters  where many of you have heard me  and elsewhere  not to be surprised or disturbed on this account. for the case is this: i now for the first time come before a court of justice  though more than seventy years old; i am therefore utterly a stranger to the language here. as  then  if i were really a stranger  you would have pardoned me if i spoke in the language and the manner in which i had been educated  so now i ask this of you as an act of justice  as it appears to me  to disregard the manner of my speech  for perhaps it may be somewhat worse  and perhaps better  and to consider this only  and to give your attention to this  whether i speak what is just or not; for this is the virtue of a judge  but of an orator to speak the truth.  2. first  then  o athenians! i am right in defending myself against the first false accusations alleged against me  and my first accusers  and then against the latest accusations  and the latest accusers. for many have been accusers of me to you  and for many years  who have asserted nothing true  of whom i am more afraid than of anytus and his party  although they too are formidable; but those are still more formidable  athenians  who  laying hold of many of you from childhood  have persuaded you  and accused me of what is not true: \"that there is one socrates  a wise man  who occupies himself about celestial matters  and has explored every thing under the earth  and makes the worse appear the better reason.\" those  o athenians! who have spread abroad this report are my formidable accusers; for they who hear them think that such as search into these things do not believe that there are gods. in the next place  these accusers are numerous  and have accused me now for a long time; moreover  they said these things to you at that time of life in which you were most credulous  when you were boys and some of you youths  and they accused me altogether in my absence  when there was no one to defend me. but the most unreasonable thing of all is  that it is not possible to learn and mention their names  except that one of them happens to be a comic poet. such  however  as  influenced by envy and calumny  have persuaded you  and those who  being themselves persuaded  have persuaded others  all these are most difficult to deal with; for it is not possible to bring any of them forward here  nor to confute any; but it is altogether necessary to fight  as it were with a shadow  in making my defense  and to convict when there is no one to answer. consider  therefore  as i have said  that my accusers are twofold  some who have lately accused me  and others long since  whom i have made mention of; and believe that i ought to defend myself against these first; for you heard them accusing me first  and much more than these last.  well. i must make my defense  then  o athenians! and endeavor in this so short a space of time to remove from your minds the calumny which you have long entertained. i wish  indeed  it might be so  if it were at all better both for you and me  and that in making my defense i could effect something more advantageous still: i think  however  that it will be difficult  and i am not entirely ignorant what the difficulty is. nevertheless  let this turn out as may be pleasing to god  i must obey the law and make my defense.  3. let us  then  repeat from the beginning what the accusation is from which the calumny against me has arisen  and relying on which melitus has preferred this indictment against me. well. what  then  do they who charge me say in their charge? for it is necessary to read their deposition as of public accusers. \"socrates acts wickedly  and is criminally curious in searching into things under the earth  and in the heavens  and in making the worse appear the better cause  and in teaching these same things to others.\" such is the accusation: for such things you have yourselves seen in the comedy of aristophanes  one socrates there carried about  saying that he walks in the air  and acting many other buffooneries  of which i understand nothing whatever. nor do i say this as disparaging such a science  if there be any one skilled in such things  only let me not be prosecuted by melitus on a charge of this kind; but i say it  o athenians! because i have nothing to do with such matters. and i call upon most of you as witnesses of this  and require you to inform and tell each other  as many of you as have ever heard me conversing; and there are many such among you. therefore tell each other  if any one of you has ever heard me conversing little or much on such subjects. and from this you will know that other things also  which the multitude assert of me  are of a similar nature.  4. however not one of these things is true; nor  if you have heard from any one that i attempt to teach men  and require payment  is this true. though this  indeed  appears to me to be an honorable thing  if one should be able to instruct men  like gorgias the leontine  prodicus the cean  and hippias the elean. for each of these  o athenians! is able  by going through the several cities  to persuade the young men  who can attach themselves gratuitously to such of their own fellow-citizens as they please  to abandon their fellow-citizens and associate with them  giving them money and thanks besides. there is also another wise man here  a parian  who  i hear  is staying in the city. for i happened to visit a person who spends more money on the sophists than all others together: i mean callias  son of hipponicus. i therefore asked him  for he has two sons  \"callias \" i said  \"if your two sons were colts or calves  we should have had to choose a master for them  and hire a person who would make them excel in such qualities as belong to their nature; and he would have been a groom or an agricultural laborer. but now  since your sons are men  what master do you intend to choose for them? who is there skilled in the qualities that become a man and a citizen? for i suppose you must have considered this  since you have sons. is there any one \" i said  \"or not?\" \"certainly \" he answered. \"who is he?\" said i  \"and whence does he come? and on what terms does he teach?\" he replied  \"evenus the parian  socrates  for five minae.\" and i deemed evenus happy  if he really possesses this art  and teaches admirably. and i too should think highly of myself  and be very proud  if i possessed this knowledge  but i possess it not  o athenians.  5. perhaps  one of you may now object: \"but  socrates  what have you done  then? whence have these calumnies against you arisen? for surely if you had not busied yourself more than others  such a report and story would never have got abroad  unless you had done something different from what most men do. tell us  therefore  what it is  that we may not pass a hasty judgment on you.\" he who speaks thus appears to me to speak justly  and i will endeavor to show you what it is that has occasioned me this character and imputation. listen  then: to some of you perhaps i shall appear to jest  yet be assured that i shall tell you the whole truth. for i  o athenians! have acquired this character through nothing else than a certain wisdom. of what kind  then  is this wisdom? perhaps it is merely human wisdom. for in this  in truth  i appear to be wise. they probably  whom i have just now mentioned  possessed a wisdom more than human  otherwise i know not what to say about it; for i am not acquainted with it  and whosoever says i am  speaks falsely  and for the purpose of calumniating me. but  o athenians! do not cry out against me  even though i should seem to you to speak somewhat arrogantly. for the account which i am going to give you is not my own; but i shall refer to an authority whom you will deem worthy of credit. for i shall adduce to you the god at delphi as a witness of my wisdom  if i have any  and of what it is. you doubtless know chærepho: he was my associate from youth  and the associate of most of you; he accompanied you in your late exile  and returned with you. you know  then  what kind of a man chærepho was  how earnest in whatever he undertook. having once gone to delphi  he ventured to make the following inquiry of the oracle (and  as i said  o athenians! do not cry out)  for he asked if there was any one wiser than i. the pythian thereupon answered that there was not one wiser; and of this  his brother here will give you proofs  since he himself is dead.  6. consider  then  why i mention these things: it is because i am going to show you whence the calumny against me arose. for when i heard this  i reasoned thus with myself  what does the god mean? what enigma is this? for i am not conscious to myself that i am wise  either much or little. what  then  does he mean by saying that i am the wisest? for assuredly he does not speak falsely: that he could not do. and for a long time i was in doubt what he meant; afterward  with considerable difficulty  i had recourse to the following method of searching out his meaning. i went to one of those who have the character of being wise  thinking that there  if anywhere  i should confute the oracle  and show in answer to the response that this man is wiser than i  though you affirmed that i was the wisest. having  then  examined this man (for there is no occasion to mention his name; he was  however  one of our great politicians  in examining whom i felt as i proceed to describe  o athenians!)  having fallen into conversation with him  this man appeared to be wise in the opinion of most other men  and especially in his own opinion  though in fact he was not so. i thereupon endeavored to show him that he fancied himself to be wise  but really was not. hence i became odious  both to him and to many others who were present. when i left him  i reasoned thus with myself: i am wiser than this man  for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something  although he knows nothing; whereas i  as i do not know anything  so i do not fancy i do. in this trifling particular  then  i appear to be wiser than he  because i do not fancy i know what i do not know. after that i went to another who was thought to be wiser than the former  and formed the very same opinion. hence i became odious to him and to many others.  7. after this i went to others in turn  perceiving indeed  and grieving and alarmed  that i was making myself odious; however  it appeared necessary to regard the oracle of the god as of the greatest moment  and that  in order to discover its meaning  i must go to all who had the reputation of possessing any knowledge. and by the dog  o athenians! for i must tell you the truth  i came to some such conclusion as this: those who bore the highest reputation appeared to me to be most deficient  in my researches in obedience to the god  and others who were considered inferior more nearly approaching to the possession of understanding. but i must relate to you my wandering  and the labors which i underwent  in order that the oracle might prove incontrovertible. for after the politicians i went to the poets  as well the tragic as the dithyrambic and others  expecting that here i should in very fact find myself more ignorant than they. taking up  therefore  some of their poems  which appeared to me most elaborately finished  i questioned them as to their meaning  that at the same time i might learn something from them. i am ashamed  o athenians! to tell you the truth; however  it must be told. for  in a word  almost all who were present could have given a better account of them than those by whom they had been composed. i soon discovered this  therefore  with regard to the poets  that they do not effect their object by wisdom  but by a certain natural inspiration  and under the influence of enthusiasm  like prophets and seers; for these also say many fine things  but they understand nothing that they say. the poets appeared to me to be affected in a similar manner; and at the same time i perceived that they considered themselves  on account of their poetry  to be the wisest of men in other things  in which they were not. i left them  therefore  under the persuasion that i was superior to them  in the same way that i was to the politicians.  8. at last  therefore  i went to the artisans. for i was conscious to myself that i knew scarcely anything  but i was sure that i should find them possessed of much beautiful knowledge. and in this i was not deceived; for they knew things which i did not  and in this respect they were wiser than i. but  o athenians! even the best workmen appeared to me to have fallen into the same error as the poets; for each  because he excelled in the practice of his art  thought that he was very wise in other most important matters  and this mistake of theirs obscured the wisdom that they really possessed. i therefore asked myself  in behalf of the oracle  whether i should prefer to continue as i am  possessing none  either of their wisdom or their ignorance  or to have both as they have. i answered  therefore  to myself and to the oracle  that it was better for me to continue as i am.  9. from this investigation  then  o athenians! many enmities have arisen against me  and those the most grievous and severe  so that many calumnies have sprung from them  and among them this appellation of being wise; for those who are from time to time present think that i am wise in those things  with respect to which i expose the ignorance of others. the god  however  o athenians! appears to be really wise  and to mean this by his oracle: that human wisdom is worth little or nothing; and it is clear that he did not say this to socrates  but made use of my name  putting me forward as an example  as if he had said  that man is the wisest among you  who  like socrates  knows that he is in reality worth nothing with respect to wisdom. still  therefore  i go about and search and inquire into these things  in obedience to the god  both among citizens and strangers  if i think any one of them is wise; and when he appears to me not to be so  i take the part of the god  and show that he is not wise. and  in consequence of this occupation  i have no leisure to attend in any considerable degree to the affairs of the state or my own; but i am in the greatest poverty through my devotion to the service of the god.  10. in addition to this  young men  who have much leisure and belong to the wealthiest families  following me of their own accord  take great delight in hearing men put to the test  and often imitate me  and themselves attempt to put others to the test; and then  i think  they find a great abundance of men who fancy they know something  although they know little or nothing. hence those who are put to the test by them are angry with me  and not with them  and say that \"there is one socrates  a most pestilent fellow  who corrupts the youth.\" and when any one asks them by doing or teaching what  they have nothing to say  for they do not know; but  that they may not seem to be at a loss  they say such things as are ready at hand against all philosophers; \"that he searches into things in heaven and things under the earth  that he does not believe there are gods  and that he makes the worse appear the better reason.\" for they would not  i think  be willing to tell the truth that they have been detected in pretending to possess knowledge  whereas they know nothing. therefore  i think  being ambitions and vehement and numerous  and speaking systematically and persuasively about me  they have filled your ears  for a long time and diligently calumniating me. from among these  melitus  anytus and lycon have attacked me; melitus being angry on account of the poets  anytus on account of the artisans and politicians  and lycon on account of the rhetoricians. so that  as i said in the beginning  i should wonder if i were able in so short a time to remove from your minds a calumny that has prevailed so long. this  o athenians! is the truth; and i speak it without concealing or disguising anything from you  much or little; though i very well know that by so doing i shall expose myself to odium. this  however  is a proof that i speak the truth  and that this is the nature of the calumny against me  and that these are its causes. and if you will investigate the matter  either now or hereafter  you will find it to be so.  11. with respect  then  to the charges which my first accusers have alleged against me  let this be a sufficient apology to you. to melitus  that good and patriotic man  as he says  and to my later accusers  i will next endeavor to give an answer; and here  again  as there are different accusers  let us take up their deposition. it is pretty much as follows: \"socrates \" it says  \"acts unjustly in corrupting the youth  and in not believing in those gods in whom the city believes  but in other strange divinities.\" such is the accusation; let us examine each particular of it. it says that i act unjustly in corrupting the youth. but i  o athenians! say that melitus acts unjustly  because he jests on serious subjects  rashly putting men upon trial  under pretense of being zealous and solicitous about things in which he never at any time took any concern. but that this is the case i will endeavor to prove to you.  12. come  then  melitus  tell me  do you not consider it of the greatest importance that the youth should be made as virtuous as possible?   mel.  i do.   socr.  well  now  tell the judges who it is that makes them better  for it is evident that you know  since it concerns you so much; for  having detected me in corrupting them  as you say  you have cited me here  and accused me: come  then  say  and inform the judges who it is that makes them better. do you see  melitus  that you are silent  and have nothing to say? but does it not appear to you to be disgraceful  and a sufficient proof of what i say  that you never took any concern about the matter? but tell me  friend  who makes them better?   mel.  the laws.   socr.  i do not ask this  most excellent sir  but what man  who surely must first know this very thing  the laws?   mel.  these  socrates  the judges.   socr.  how say you  melitus? are these able to instruct the youth  and make them better?   mel.  certainly.   socr.  whether all  or some of them  and others not?   mel.  all.   socr.  you say well  by juno! and have found a great abundance of those that confer benefit. but what further? can these hearers make them better  or not?   mel.  they  too  can.   socr.  and what of the senators?   mel.  the senators  also.   socr.  but  melitus  do those who attend the public assemblies corrupt the younger men? or do they all make them better?   mel.  they too.   socr.  all the athenians  therefore  as it seems  make them honorable and good  except me; but i alone corrupt them. do you say so?   mel.  i do assert this very thing.   socr.  you charge me with great ill-fortune. but answer me: does it appear to you to be the same  with respect to horses? do all men make them better  and is there only some one that spoils them? or does quite the contrary of this take place? is there some one person who can make them better  or very few; that is  the trainers? but if the generality of men should meddle with and make use of horses  do they spoil them? is not this the case  melitus  both with respect to horses and all other animals? it certainly is so  whether you and anytus deny it or not. for it would be a great good-fortune for the youth if only one person corrupted  and the rest benefited them. however  melitus  you have sufficiently shown that you never bestowed any care upon youth; and you clearly evince your own negligence  in that you have never paid any attention to the things with respect to which you accuse me.  13. tell us further  melitus  in the name of jupiter  whether is it better to dwell with good or bad citizens? answer  my friend; for i ask you nothing difficult. do not the bad work some evil to those that are continually near them  but the good some good?   mel.  certainly.   socr.  is there any one that wishes to be injured rather than benefited by his associates? answer  good man; for the law requires you to answer. is there any one who wishes to be injured?   mel.  no  surely.   socr.  come  then  whether do you accuse me here  as one that corrupts the youth  and makes them more depraved  designedly or undesignedly?   mel.  designedly  i say.   socr.  what  then  melitus  are you at your time of life so much wiser than i at my time of life  as to know that the evil are always working some evil to those that are most near to them  and the good some good; but i have arrived at such a pitch of ignorance as not to know that if i make any one of my associates depraved  i shall be in danger of receiving some evil from him; and yet i designedly bring about this so great evil  as you say? in this i can not believe you  melitus  nor do i think would any other man in the world. but either i do not corrupt the youth  or  if i do corrupt them  i do it undesignedly: so that in both cases you speak falsely. but if i corrupt them undesignedly  for such involuntary offenses it is not usual to accuse one here  but to take one apart  and teach and admonish one. for it is evident that if i am taught  i shall cease doing what i do undesignedly. but you shunned me  and were not willing to associate with and instruct me; but you accuse me here  where it is usual to accuse those who need punishment  and not instruction.  14. thus  then  o athenians! this now is clear that i have said; that melitus never paid any attention to these matters  much or little. however  tell us  melitus  how you say i corrupt the youth? is it not evidently  according to the indictment which you have preferred  by teaching them not to believe in the gods in whom the city believes  but in other strange deities? do you not say that  by teaching these things  i corrupt the youth?   mel.  certainly i do say so.   socr.  by those very gods  therefore  melitus  of whom the discussion now is  speak still more clearly both to me and to these men. for i can not understand whether you say that i teach them to believe that there are certain gods (and in that case i do believe that there are gods  and am not altogether an atheist  nor in this respect to blame)  not  however  those which the city believes in  but others; and this it is that you accuse me of  that i introduce others. or do you say outright that i do not myself believe that there are gods  and that i teach others the same?   mel.  i say this: that you do not believe in any gods at all.   socr.  o wonderful melitus  how come you to say this? do i not  then  like the rest of mankind  believe that the sun and moon are gods?   mel.  no  by jupiter  o judges! for he says that the sun is a stone  and the moon an earth.   socr.  you fancy that you are accusing anaxagoras  my dear melitus  and thus you put a slight on these men  and suppose them to be so illiterate as not to know that the books of anaxagoras of clazomene are full of such assertions. and the young  moreover  learn these things from me  which they might purchase for a drachma  at most  in the orchestra  and so ridicule socrates  if he pretended they were his own  especially since they are so absurd? i ask then  by jupiter  do i appear to you to believe that there is no god?   mel.  no  by jupiter  none whatever.   socr.  you say what is incredible  melitus  and that  as appears to me  even to yourself. for this man  o athenians! appears to me to be very insolent and intemperate and to have preferred this indictment through downright insolence  intemperance  and wantonness. for he seems  as it were  to have composed an enigma for the purpose of making an experiment. whether will socrates the wise know that i am jesting  and contradict myself  or shall i deceive him and all who hear me? for  in my opinion  he clearly contradicts himself in the indictment  as if he should say  socrates is guilty of wrong in not believing that there are gods  and in believing that there are gods. and this  surely  is the act of one who is trifling.  15. consider with me now  athenians  in what respect he appears to me to say so. and do you  melitus  answer me; and do ye  as i besought you at the outset  remember not to make an uproar if i speak after my usual manner.  is there any man  melitus  who believes that there are human affairs  but does not believe that there are men? let him answer  judges  and not make so much noise. is there any one who does not believe that there are horses  but that there are things pertaining to horses? or who does not believe that there are pipers  but that there are things pertaining to pipes? there is not  o best of men! for since you are not willing to answer  i say it to you and to all here present. but answer to this at least: is there any one who believes that there are things relating to demons  but does not believe that there are demons?   mel.  there is not.   socr.  how obliging you are in having hardly answered; though compelled by these judges! you assert  then  that i do believe and teach things relating to demons  whether they be new or old; therefore  according to your admission  i do believe in things relating to demons  and this you have sworn in the bill of indictment. if  then  i believe in things relating to demons  there is surely an absolute necessity that i should believe that there are demons. is it not so? it is. for i suppose you to assent  since you do not answer. but with respect to demons  do we not allow that they are gods  or the children of gods? do you admit this or not?   mel.  certainly.   socr.  since  then  i allow that there are demons  as you admit  if demons are a kind of gods  this is the point in which i say you speak enigmatically and divert yourself in saying that i do not allow there are gods  and again that i do allow there are  since i allow that there are demons? but if demons are the children of gods  spurious ones  either from nymphs or any others  of whom they are reported to be  what man can think that there are sons of gods  and yet that there are not gods? for it would be just as absurd as if any one should think that there are mules  the offspring of horses and asses  but should not think there are horses and asses. however  melitus  it can not be otherwise than that you have preferred this indictment for the purpose of trying me  or because you were at a loss what real crime to allege against me; for that you should persuade any man who has the smallest degree of sense that the same person can think that there are things relating to demons and to gods  and yet that there are neither demons  nor gods  not heroes  is utterly impossible.  16. that i am not guilty  then  o athenians! according to the indictment of melitus  appears to me not to require a lengthened defense; but what i have said is sufficient. and as to what i said at the beginning  that there is a great enmity toward me among the multitude  be assured it is true. and this it is which will condemn me  if i am condemned  not melitus  nor anytus  but the calumny and envy of the multitude  which have already condemned many others  and those good men  and will  i think  condemn others also; for there is no danger that it will stop with me.  perhaps  however  some one may say  \"are you not ashamed  socrates  to have pursued a study from which you are now in danger of dying?\" to such a person i should answer with good reason  you do not say well  friend  if you think that a man  who is even of the least value  ought to take into the account the risk of life or death  and ought not to consider that alone when be performs any action  whether he is acting justly or unjustly  and the part of a good man or bad man. for  according to your reasoning  all those demi-gods that died at troy would be vile characters  as well all the rest as the son of thetis  who so far despised danger in comparison of submitting to disgrace  that when his mother  who was a goddess  spoke to him  in his impatience to kill hector  something to this effect  as i think  \"my son  if you revenge the death of your friend patroclus  and slay hector  you will yourself die  for \" she said  \"death awaits you immediately after hector;\" but he  on hearing this  despised death and danger  and dreading much more to live as a coward  and not avenge his friend  said  \"may i die immediately when i have inflicted punishment on the guilty  that i may not stay here an object of ridicule  by the curved ships  a burden to the ground?\"--do you think that he cared for death and danger? for thus it is  o athenians! in truth: wherever any one has posted himself  either thinking it to be better  or has been posted by his chief  there  as it appears to me  he ought to remain and meet danger  taking no account either of death or anything else in comparison with disgrace.  17. i then should be acting strangely  o athenians! if  when the generals whom you chose to command me assigned me my post at potidæa  at amphipolis  and at delium  i then remained where they posted me  like any other person  and encountered the danger of death; but when the deity  as i thought and believed  assigned it as my duty to pass my life in the study of philosophy  and examining myself and others  i should on that occasion  through fear of death or any thing else whatsoever  desert my post  strange indeed would it be; and then  in truth  any one might justly bring me to trial  and accuse me of not believing in the gods  from disobeying the oracle  fearing death  and thinking myself to be wise when i am not. for to fear death  o athenians! is nothing else than to appear to be wise  without being so; for it is to appear to know what one does not know. for no one knows but that death is the greatest of all good to man; but men fear it  as if they well knew that it is the greatest of evils. and how is not this the most reprehensible ignorance  to think that one knows what one does not know? but i  o athenians! in this  perhaps  differ from most men; and if i should say that i am in any thing wiser than another  it would be in this  that not having a competent knowledge of the things in hades  i also think that i have not such knowledge. but to act unjustly  and to disobey my superior  whether god or man  i know is evil and base. i shall never  therefore  fear or shun things which  for aught i know  maybe good  before evils which i know to be evils. so that  even if you should now dismiss me  not yielding to the instances of anytus  who said that either i should not appear here at all  or that  if i did appear  it was impossible not to put me to death  telling you that if i escaped  your sons  studying what socrates teaches  would all be utterly corrupted; if you should address me thus  \"socrates  we shall not now yield to anytus  but dismiss you  on this condition  however  that you no longer persevere in your researches nor study philosophy; and if hereafter you are detected in so doing  you shall die\"--if  as i said  you should dismiss  me on these terms  i should say to you  \"o athenians! i honor and love you; but i shall obey god rather than you; and so long as i breathe and am able  i shall not cease studying philosophy  and exhorting you and warning any one of you i may happen to meet  saying  as i have been accustomed to do:  o best of men! seeing you are an athenian  of a city the most powerful and most renowned for wisdom and strength  are you not ashamed of being careful for riches  how you may acquire them in greatest abundance  and for glory  and honor  but care not nor take any thought for wisdom and truth  and for your soul  how it maybe made most perfect? \" and if any one of you should question my assertion  and affirm that he does care for these things  i shall not at once let him go  nor depart  but i shall question him  sift and prove him. and if he should appear to me not to possess virtue  but to pretend that he does  i shall reproach him for that he sets the least value on things of the greatest worth  but the highest on things that are worthless. thus i shall act to all whom i meet  both young and old  stranger and citizen  but rather to you  my fellow-citizens  because ye are more nearly allied to me. for be well assured  this the deity commands. and i think that no greater good has ever befallen you in the city than my zeal for the service of the god. for i go about doing nothing else than persuading you  both young and old  to take no care either for the body  or for riches  prior to or so much as for the soul  how it may be made most perfect  telling you that virtue does not spring from riches  but riches and all other human blessings  both private and public  from virtue. if  then  by saying these things  i corrupt the youth  these things must be mischievous; but if any one says that i speak other things than these  he misleads you. therefore i must say  o athenians! either yield to anytus  or do not  either dismiss me or not  since i shall not act otherwise  even though i must die many deaths.  18. murmur not  o athenians! but continue to attend to my request  not to murmur at what i say  but to listen  for  as i think  you will derive benefit from listening. for i am going to say other things to you  at which  perhaps  you will raise a clamor; but on no account do so. be well assured  then  if you put me to death  being such a man as i say i am  you will not injure me more than yourselves. for neither will melitus nor anytus harm me; nor have they the power; for i do not think that it is possible for a better man to be injured by a worse. he may perhaps have me condemned to death  or banished  or deprived of civil rights; and he or others may perhaps consider these as mighty evils; i  how ever  do not consider them so  but that it is much more so to do what he is now doing  to endeavor to put a man to death unjustly. now  therefore  o athenians! i am far from making a defense on my behalf  as any one might think  but i do so on your own behalf  lest by condemning me you should offend at all with respect to the gift of the deity to you. for  if you should put me to death  you will not easily find such another  though it may be ridiculous to say so  altogether attached by the deity to this city as to a powerful and generous horse  somewhat sluggish from his size  and requiring to be roused by a gad-fly; so the deity appears to have united me  being such a person as i am  to the city  that i may rouse you  and persuade and reprove every one of you  nor ever cease besetting you throughout the whole day. such another man  o athenians! will not easily be found; therefore  if you will take my advice  you will spare me. but you  perhaps  being irritated like drowsy persons who are roused from sleep  will strike me  and  yielding to anytus  will unthinkingly condemn me to death; and then you will pass the rest of your life in sleep  unless the deity  caring for you  should send some one else to you. but that i am a person who has been given by the deity to this city  you may discern from hence; for it is not like the ordinary conduct of men  that i should have neglected all my own affairs  and suffered my private interest to be neglected for so many years  and that i should constantly attend to your concerns  addressing myself to each of you separately  like a father  or elder brother  persuading you to the pursuit of virtue. and if i had derived any profit from this course  and had received pay for my exhortations  there would have been some reason for my conduct; but now you see yourselves that my accusers  who have so shamelessly calumniated me in everything else  have not had the impudence to charge me with this  and to bring witnesses to prove that i ever either exacted or demanded any reward. and i think i produce a sufficient proof that i speak the truth  namely  my poverty.  19. perhaps  however  it may appear absurd that i  going about  thus advise you in private and make myself busy  but never venture to present myself in public before your assemblies and give advice to the city. the cause of this is that which you have often and in many places heard me mention; because i am moved by a certain divine and spiritual influence  which also melitus  through mockery  has set out in the indictment. this began with me from childhood  being a kind of voice which  when present  always diverts me from what i am about to do  but never urges me on. this it is which opposed my meddling in public politics; and it appears to me to have opposed me very properly. for be well assured  o athenians! if i had long since attempted to intermeddle with politics  i should have perished long ago  and should not have at all benefited you or myself. and be not angry with me for speaking the truth. for it is not possible that any man should be safe who sincerely opposes either you  or any other multitude  and who prevents many unjust and illegal actions from being committed in a city; but it is necessary that he who in earnest contends for justice  if he will be safe for but a short time  should live privately  and take no part in public affairs.  20. i will give you strong proofs of this  not words  but what you value  facts. hear  then  what has happened to me  that you may know that i would not yield to any one contrary to what is just  through fear of death  at the same time by not yielding i must perish. i shall tell you what will be displeasing and wearisome  yet true. for i  o athenians! never bore any other magisterial office in the city  but have been a senator: and our antiochean tribe happened to supply the prytanes when you chose to condemn in a body the ten generals who had not taken off those that perished in the sea-fight  in violation of the law  as you afterward all thought. at that time i alone of the prytanes opposed your doing anything contrary to the laws  and i voted against you; and when the orators were ready to denounce me  and to carry me before a magistrate  and you urged and cheered them on  i thought i ought rather to meet the danger with law and justice on my side  than through fear of imprisonment or death  to take part with you in your unjust designs. and this happened while the city was governed by a democracy. but when it became an oligarchy  the thirty  having sent for me with four others to the tholus  ordered us to bring leon the salaminian from salamis  that he might be put to death; and they gave many similar orders to many others  wishing to involve as many as they could in guilt. then  however  i showed  not in word but in deed  that i did not care for death  if the expression be not too rude  in the smallest degree; but that all my care was to do nothing unjust or unholy. for that government  strong as it was  did not so overawe me as to make me commit an unjust action; but when we came out from the tholus  the four went to salamis  and brought back leon; but i went away home. and perhaps for this i should have been put to death  if that government had not been speedily broken up. and of this you can have many witnesses.  21. do you think  then  that i should have survived so many years if i had engaged in public affairs  and  acting as becomes a good man  had aided the cause of justice  and  as i ought  had deemed this of the highest importance? far from it  o athenians! nor would any other man have done so. but i  through the whole of my life  if i have done anything in public  shall be found to be a man  and the very same in private  who has never made a concession to any one contrary to justice  neither to any other  nor to any one of these whom my calumniators say are my disciples. i  however  was never the preceptor of any one; but if any one desired to hear me speaking  and to see me busied about my own mission  whether he were young or old  i never refused him. nor do i discourse when i receive money  and not when i do not receive any  but i allow both rich and poor alike to question me  and  if any one wishes it  to answer me and hear what i have to say. and for these  whether any one proves to be a good man or not  i cannot justly be responsible  because i never either promised them any instruction or taught them at all. but if any one says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all others have not  be well assured that he does not speak the truth.  22. but why do some delight to spend so long a time with me? ye have heard  o athenians! i have told you the whole truth  that they delight to hear those closely questioned who think that they are wise but are not; for this is by no means disagreeable. but this duty  as i say  has been enjoined me by the deity  by oracles  by dreams  and by every mode by which any other divine decree has ever enjoined anything to man to do. these things  o athenians! are both true  and easily confuted if not true. for if i am now corrupting some of the youths  and have already corrupted others  it were fitting  surely  that if any of them  having become advanced in life  had discovered that i gave them bad advice when they were young  they should now rise up against me  accuse me  and have me punished; or if they were themselves unwilling to do this  some of their kindred  their fathers  or brothers  or other relatives  if their kinsman have ever sustained any damage from me  should now call it to mind. many of them  however  are here present  whom i see: first  crito  my contemporary and fellow-burgher  father of this critobulus; then lysanias of sphettus  father of this æschines; again  antiphon of cephisus  father of epigenes. there are those others  too  whose brothers maintained the same intimacy with me  namely  nicostratus  son of theodotus  brother of theodotus--theodotus indeed is dead  so that he could not deprecate his brother s proceedings--and paralus here  son of demodocus  whose brother was theages; and adimantus  son of ariston  whose brother is this plato; and æantodorus  whose brother is this apollodorus. i could also mention many others to you  some one of whom certainly melitus ought to have adduced in his speech as a witness. if  however  he then forgot to do so  let him now adduce them; i give him leave to do so  and let him say it  if he has anything of the kind to allege. but  quite contrary to this  you will find  o athenians! all ready to assist me  who have corrupted and injured their relatives  as melitus and anytus say. for those who have been themselves corrupted might perhaps have some reason for assisting me; but those who have not been corrupted  men now advanced in life  their relatives  what other reason can they have for assisting me  except that right and just one  that they know that melitus speaks falsely  and that i speak the truth.  23. well  then  athenians  these are pretty much the things i have to say in my defense  and others perhaps of the same kind. perhaps  however  some among you will be indignant on recollecting his own case  if he  when engaged in a cause far less than this  implored and besought the judges with many tears  bringing forward his children in order that he might excite their utmost compassion  and many others of his relatives and friends  whereas i do none of these things  although i may appear to be incurring the extremity of danger. perhaps  therefore  some one  taking notice of this  may become more determined against me  and  being enraged at this very conduct of mine  may give his vote under the influence of anger. if  then  any one of you is thus affected--i do not  however  suppose that there is--but if there should be  i think i may reasonably say to him: \"i  too  o best of men  have relatives; for  to make use of that saying of homer  i am not sprung from an oak  nor from a rock  but from men  so that i  too  o athenians! have relatives  and three sons  one now grown up  and two boys: i shall not  however  bring any one of them forward and implore you to acquit me.\" why  then  shall i not do this? not from contumacy  o athenians! nor disrespect toward you. whether or not i am undaunted at the prospect of death is another question; but  out of regard to my own character  and yours  and that of the whole city  it does not appear to me to be honorable that i should do any thing of this kind at my age  and with the reputation i have  whether true or false. for it is commonly agreed that socrates in some respects excels the generality of men. if  then  those among you who appear to excel either in wisdom  or fortitude  or any other virtue whatsoever  should act in such a manner as i have often seen some when they have been brought to trial  it would be shameful  who appearing indeed to be something  have conducted themselves in a surprising manner  as thinking they should suffer something dreadful by dying  and as if they would be immortal if you did not put them to death. such men appear to me to bring disgrace on the city  so that any stranger might suppose that such of the athenians as excel in virtue  and whom they themselves choose in preference to themselves for magistracies and other honors  are in no respect superior to women. for these things  o athenians! neither ought we to do who have attained to any height of reputation  nor  should we do them  ought you to suffer us; but you should make this manifest  that you will much rather condemn him who introduces these piteous dramas  and makes the city ridiculous  than him who quietly awaits your decision.  24. but  reputation apart  o athenians! it does not appear to me to be right to entreat a judge  or to escape by entreaty; but one ought to inform and persuade him. for a judge does not sit for the purpose of administering justice out of favor  but that he may judge rightly  and he is sworn not to show favor to whom he pleases  but that he will decide according to the laws. it is  therefore  right that neither should we accustom you  nor should you accustom yourselves  to violate your oaths; for in so doing neither of us would act righteously. think not then  o athenians! that i ought to adopt such a course toward you as i neither consider honorable  nor just  nor holy  as well  by jupiter! on any other occasion  and now especially when i am accused of impiety by this melitus. for clearly  if i should persuade you  and by my entreaties should put a constraint on you who are bound by an oath  i should teach you to think that there are no gods  and in reality  while making my defense  should accuse myself of not believing in the gods. this  however  is far from being the case; for i believe  o athenians! as none of my accusers do  and i leave it to you and to the deity to judge concerning me in such way as will be best both for me and for you.    25. that i should not be grieved  o athenians! at what has happened--namely  that you have condemned me--as well many other circumstances concur in bringing to pass; and  moreover this  that what has happened has not happened contrary to my expectation; but i much rather wonder at the number of votes on either side. for i did not expect that i should be condemned by so small a number  but by a large majority; but now  as it seems  if only three more votes had changed sides  i should have been acquitted. so far as melitus is concerned  as it appears to me  i have been already acquitted; and not only have i been acquitted  but it is clear to every one that had not anytus and lycon come forward to accuse me  he would have been fined a thousand drachmas  for not having obtained a fifth part of the votes.  26. the man  then  awards me the penalty of death. well. but what shall i  on my part  o athenians! award myself? is it not clear that it will be such as i deserve? what  then  is that? do i deserve to suffer  or to pay a fine? for that i have purposely during my life not remained quiet  but neglecting what most men seek after  money-making  domestic concerns  military command  popular oratory  and  moreover  all the magistracies  conspiracies  and cabals that are met with in the city  thinking that i was in reality too upright a man to be safe if i took part in such things  i therefore did not apply myself to those pursuits  by attending to which i should have been of no service either to you or to myself; but in order to confer the greatest benefit on each of you privately  as i affirm  i thereupon applied myself to that object  endeavoring to persuade every one of you not to take any care of his own affairs before he had taken care of himself in what way he may become the best and wisest  nor of the affairs of the city before he took care of the city itself; and that he should attend to other things in the same manner. what treatment  then  do i deserve  seeing i am such a man? some reward  o athenians! if  at least  i am to be estimated according to my real deserts; and  moreover  such a reward as would be suitable to me. what  then  is suitable to a poor man  a benefactor  and who has need of leisure in order to give you good advice? there is nothing so suitable  o athenians! as that such a man should be maintained in the prytaneum  and this much more than if one of you had been victorious at the olympic games in a horserace  or in the two or four horsed chariot race: for such a one makes you appear to be happy  but i  to be so; and he does not need support  but i do. if  therefore  i must award a sentence according to my just deserts  i award this  maintenance in the prytaneum.  27. perhaps  however  in speaking to you thus  i appear to you to speak in the same presumptuous manner as i did respecting commiseration and entreaties; but such is not the case  o athenians! it is rather this: i am persuaded that i never designedly injured any man  though i can not persuade you of this  for we have conversed with each other but for a short time. for if there were the same law with you as with other men  that in capital cases the trial should list not only one day  but many  i think you would be persuaded; but it is not easy in a short time to do away with  great calumnies. being persuaded  then  that i have injured no one  i am far from intending to injure myself  and of pronouncing against myself that i am deserving of punishment  and from awarding myself any thing of the kind. through fear of what? lest i should suffer that which melitus awards me  of which i say i know not whether it he good or evil? instead of this  shall i choose what i well know to be evil  and award that? shall i choose imprisonment? and why should i live in prison  a slave to the established magistracy  the eleven? shall i choose a fine  and to be imprisoned until i have paid it? but this is the same as that which i just now mentioned  for i have not money to pay it. shall i  then  award myself exile? for perhaps you would consent to this award. i should indeed be very fond of life  o athenians! if i were so devoid of reason as not to be able to reflect that you  who are my fellow-citizens  have been unable to endure my manner of life and discourses  but they have become so burdensome and odious to you that you now seek to be rid of them: others  however  will easily bear them. far from it  o athenians! a fine life it would be for me at my age to go out wandering  and driven from city to city  and so to live. for i well know that  wherever i may go  the youth will listen to me when i speak  as they do here. and if i repulse them  they will themselves drive me out  persuading the elders; and if i do not repulse them  their fathers and kindred will banish me on their account.  28. perhaps  however  some one will say  can you not  socrates  when you have gone from us  live a silent and quiet life? this is the most difficult thing of all to persuade some of you. for if i say that that would be to disobey the deity  and that  therefore  it is impossible for me to live quietly  you would not believe me  thinking i spoke ironically. if  on the other hand  i say that this is the greatest good to man  to discourse daily on virtue  and other things which you have heard me discussing  examining both myself and others  but that a life without investigation is not worth living for  still less would you believe me if i said this. such  however  is the case  as i affirm  o athenians! though it is not easy to persuade you. and at the same time i am not accustomed to think myself deserving of any ill. if  indeed  i were rich  i would amerce myself in such a sum as i should be able to pay; for then i should have suffered no harm  but now--for i can not  unless you are willing to amerce me in such a sum as i am able to pay. but perhaps i could pay you a mina of silver: in that sum  then  i amerce myself. but plato here  o athenians! and crito critobulus  and apollodorus bid me amerce myself in thirty minae  and they offer to be sureties. i amerce myself  then  to you in that sum; and they will be sufficient sureties for the money.    29. for the sake of no long space of time  o athenians! you will incur the character and reproach at the hands of those who wish to defame the city  of having put that wise man  socrates  to death. for those who wish to defame you will assert that i am wise  though i am not. if  then  you had waited for a short time  this would have happened of its own accord; for observe my age  that it is far advanced in life  and near death. but i say this not to you all  but to those only who have condemned me to die. and i say this  too  to the same persons. perhaps you think  o athenians! that i have been convicted through the want of arguments  by which i might have persuaded you  had i thought it right to do and say any thing  so that i might escape punishment. far otherwise: i have been convicted through want indeed  yet not of arguments  but of audacity and impudence  and of the inclination to say such things to you as would have been most agreeable for you to hear  had i lamented and bewailed and done and said many other things unworthy of me  as i affirm  but such as you are accustomed to hear from others. but neither did i then think that i ought  for the sake of avoiding danger  to do any thing unworthy of a freeman  nor do i now repent of having so defended myself; but i should much rather choose to die  having so defended myself  than to live in that way. for neither in a trial nor in battle is it right that i or any one else should employ every possible means whereby he may avoid death; for in battle it is frequently evident that a man might escape death by laying down his arms  and throwing himself on the mercy of his pursuers. and there are many other devices in every danger  by which to avoid death  if a man dares to do and say every thing. but this is not difficult  o athenians! to escape death; but it is much more difficult to avoid depravity  for it runs swifter than death. and now i  being slow and aged  am overtaken by the slower of the two; but my accusers  being strong and active  have been overtaken by the swifter  wickedness. and now i depart  condemned by you to death; but they condemned by truth  as guilty of iniquity and injustice: and i abide my sentence  and so do they. these things  perhaps  ought so to be  and i think that they are for the best.  30. in the next place  i desire to predict to you who have condemned me  what will be your fate; for i am now in that condition in which men most frequently prophesy--namely  when they are about to die. i say  then  to you  o athenians! who have condemned me to death  that immediately after my death a punishment will overtake you  far more severe  by jupiter! than that which you have inflicted on me. for you have done this  thinking you should be freed from the necessity of giving an account of your lives. the very contrary  however  as i affirm  will happen to you. your accusers will be more numerous  whom i have now restrained  though you did not perceive it; and they will be more severe  inasmuch as they are younger  and you will be more indignant. for if you think that by putting men to death you will restrain any one from upbraiding you because you do not live well  you are much mistaken; for this method of escape is neither possible nor honorable; but that other is most honorable and most easy  not to put a check upon others  but for a man to take heed to himself how he may be most perfect. having predicted thus much to those of you who have condemned me  i take my leave of you.  31. but with you who have voted for my acquittal i would gladly hold converse on what has now taken place  while the magistrates are busy  and i am not yet carried to the place where i must die. stay with me  then  so long  o athenians! for nothing hinders our conversing with each other  while we are permitted to do so; for i wish to make known to you  as being my friends  the meaning of that which has just now befallen me. to me  then  o my judges! and in calling you judges i call you rightly--a strange thing has happened. for the wonted prophetic voice of my guardian deity on every former occasion  even in the most trifling affairs  opposed me if i was about to do any thing wrong; but now that has befallen me which ye yourselves behold  and which any one would think  and which is supposed to be the extremity of evil; yet neither when i departed from home in the morning did the warning of the god oppose me  nor when i came up here to the place of trial  nor in my address when i was about to say any thing; yet on other occasions it has frequently restrained me in the midst of speaking. but now it has never  throughout this proceeding  opposed me  either in what i did or said. what  then  do i suppose to be the cause of this? i will tell you: what has befallen me appears to be a blessing; and it is impossible that we think rightly who suppose that death is an evil. a great proof of this to me is the fact that it is impossible but that the accustomed signal should have opposed me  unless i had been about to meet with some good.  32. moreover  we may hence conclude that there is great hope that death is a blessing. for to die is one of two things: for either the dead may be annihilated  and have no sensation of any thing whatever; or  as it is said  there are a certain change and passage of the soul from one place to another. and if it is a privation of all sensation  as it were a sleep in which the sleeper has no dream  death would be a wonderful gain. for i think that if any one  having selected a night in which he slept so soundly as not to have had a dream  and having compared this night with all the other nights and days of his life  should be required  on consideration  to say how many days and nights he had passed better and more pleasantly than this night throughout his life  i think that not only a private person  but even the great king himself  would find them easy to number  in comparison with other days and nights. if  therefore  death is a thing of this kind  i say it is a gain; for thus all futurity appears to be nothing more than one night. but if  on the other hand  death is a removal from hence to another place  and what is said be true  that all the dead are there  what greater blessing can there be than this  my judges? for if  on arriving at hades  released from these who pretend to be judges  one shall find those who are true judges  and who are said to judge there  minos and rhadamanthus  æacus and triptolemus  and such others of the demi-gods as were just during their own life  would this be a sad removal? at what price would you not estimate a conference with orpheus and musæus  hesiod and homer? i indeed should be willing to die often  if this be true. for to me the sojourn there would be admirable  when i should meet with palamedes  and ajax  son of telamon  and any other of the ancients who has died by an unjust sentence. the comparing my sufferings with theirs would  i think  be no unpleasing occupation. but the greatest pleasure would be to spend my time in questioning and examining the people there as i have done those here  and discovering who among them is wise  and who fancies himself to be so  but is not. at what price  my judges  would not any one estimate the opportunity of questioning him who led that mighty army against troy  or ulysses  or sisyphus  or ten thousand others whom one might mention both men and women--with whom to converse and associate  and to question them  would be an inconceivable happiness? surely for that the judges there do not condemn to death; for in other respects those who live there are more happy than those who are here  and are henceforth immortal  if  at least  what is said be true.  33. you  therefore  o my judges! ought to entertain good hopes with respect to death  and to meditate on this one truth  that to a good man nothing is evil  neither while living nor when dead  nor are his concerns neglected by the gods. and what has befallen me is not the effect of chance; but this is clear to me  that now to die  and be freed from my cares is better for me on this account the warning in no way turned me aside; and i bear no resentment toward those who condemned me  or against my accusers  although they did not condemn and accuse me with this intention  but thinking to injure me: in this they deserve to be blamed.  thus much  however  i beg of them. punish my sons when they grow up  o judges! paining them as i have pained you  if they appear to you to care for riches or anything else before virtue; and if they think themselves to be something when they are nothing  reproach them as i have done you  for not attending to what they ought  and for conceiving themselves to be something when they are worth nothing. if ye do this  both i and my sons shall have met with just treatment at your hands.  but it is now time to depart--for me to die  for you to live. but which of us is going to a better state is unknown to every one but god.  crito; or  the duty of a citizen.   socrates  crito.   socr.  why have you come at this hour  crito? is it not very early?   cri.  it is.   socr.  about what time?   cri.  scarce day-break.   socr.  i wonder how the keeper of the prison came to admit you.   cri.  he is familiar with me  socrates  from my having frequently come hither; and he is under some obligations to me.   socr.  have you just now come  or some time since?   cri.  a considerable time since.   socr.  why  then  did you not wake me at once  instead of sitting down by me in silence?   cri.  by jupiter! socrates  i should not myself like to be so long awake  and in such affliction. but i have been for some time wondering at you  perceiving how sweetly you slept; and i purposely did not awake you  that you might pass your time as pleasantly as possible. and  indeed  i have often before throughout your whole life considered you happy in your disposition  but far more so in the present calamity  seeing how easily and meekly you bear it.   socr.  however  crito  it would be disconsonant for a man at my time of life to repine because he must needs die.   cri.  but others  socrates  at your age have been involved in similar calamities  yet their age has not hindered their repining at their present fortune.   socr.  so it is. but why did you come so early?   cri.  bringing sad tidings  socrates  not sad to you  as it appears  but to me  and all your friends  sad and heavy  and which i  i think  shall bear worst of all.   socr.  what tidings? has the ship arrived from delos  on the arrival of which i must die?   cri.  it has not yet arrived  but it appears to me that it will come to-day  from what certain persons report who have come from sunium  and left it there. it is clear  therefore  from these messengers  that it will come to day  and consequently it will be necessary  socrates  for you to die to-morrow.  2.  socr.  but with good fortune  crito  and if so it please the gods  so be it. i do not think  however  that it will come to day.   cri.  whence do you form this conjecture?   socr.  i will tell you. i must die on the day after that on which the ship arrives.   cri.  so they say who have the control of these things.   socr.  i do not think  then  that it will come to-day  but to-morrow. i conjecture this from a dream which i had this very night  not long ago  and you seem very opportunely to have refrained from waking me.   cri.  but what was this dream?   socr.  a beautiful and majestic woman  clad in white garments seemed to approach me  and to call to me and say  \"socrates  three days hence you will reach fertile pythia\".   cri.  what a strange dream  socrates!   socr.  very clear  however  as it appears to me  crito.  3.  cri.  very much so  as it seems. but  my dear socrates  even now be persuaded by me  and save yourself. for if you die  not only a single calamity will befall me  but  besides being deprived of such a friend as i shall never meet with again  i shall also appear to many who do not know you and me well  when i might have saved you had i been willing to spend my money  to have neglected to do so. and what character can be more disgraceful than this--to appear to value one s riches more than one s friends? for the generality of men will not be persuaded that you were unwilling to depart hence  when we urged you to it.   socr.  but why  my dear crito  should we care so much for the opinion of the many? for the most worthy men  whom we ought rather to regard  will think that matters have transpired as they really have.   cri.  yet you see  socrates  that it is necessary to attend to the opinion of the many. for the very circumstances of the present case show that the multitude are able to effect not only the smallest evils  but even the greatest  if any one is calumniated to them.   socr.  would  o crito that the multitude could effect the greatest evils  that they might also effect the greatest good  for then it would be well. but now they can do neither; for they can make a man neither wise nor foolish; but they do whatever chances.  4.  cri.  so let it be  then. but answer me this  socrates: are you not anxious for me and other friends  lest  if you should escape from hence  informers should give us trouble  as having secretly carried you off  and so we should be compelled either to lose all our property  or a very large sum  or to suffer something else besides this? for  if you fear any thing of the kind  dismiss your fears; for we are justified in running the risk to save you--and  if need be  even a greater risk than this. but be persuaded by me  and do not refuse.   socr.  i am anxious about this  crito  and about many other things.   cri.  do not fear this  however; for the sum is not large on receipt of which certain persons are willing to save you  and take you hence. in the next place  do you not see how cheap these informers are  so that there would be no need of a large sum for them? my fortune is at your service  sufficient  i think  for the purpose; then if  out of regard to me  you do not think right to spend my money  these strangers here are ready to spend theirs. one of them  simmias the theban  has brought with him a sufficient sum for the very purpose. cebes  too  is ready  and very many others. so that  as i said  do not  through fears of this kind  hesitate to save yourself  nor let what you said in court give you any trouble  that if you went from hence you would not know what to do with yourself. for in many places  and wherever you go  men will love you; and if you are disposed to go to thessaly  i have friends there who will esteem you very highly  and will insure your safety  so that no one in thessaly will molest you.  5. moreover  socrates  you do not appear to me to pursue a just course in giving yourself up when you might be saved; and you press on the very results with respect to yourself which your enemies would press  and have pressed  in their anxiety to destroy you. besides this  too  you appear to me to betray your own sons  whom  when it is in your power to rear and educate them  you will abandon  and  so far as you are concerned  they will meet with such a fate as chance brings them  and  as is probable  they will meet with such things as orphans are wont to experience in a state of orphanage. surely one ought not to have children  or one should go through the toil of rearing and instructing them. but you appear to me to have chosen the most indolent course; though you ought to have chosen such a course as a good and brave man would have done  since you profess to have made virtue your study through the whole of your life; so that i am ashamed both for you and for us who are your friends  lest this whole affair of yours should seem to be the effect of cowardice on our part--your appearing to stand your trial in the court  since you appeared when it was in your power not to have done so  the very manner in which the trial was conducted  and this last circumstance  as it were  a ridiculous consummation of the whole business; your appearing to have escaped from us through our indolence and cowardice  who did not save you; nor did you save yourself  when it was practicable and possible  had we but exerted ourselves a little. think of these things  therefore  socrates  and beware  lest  besides the evil  that will result   they be disgraceful both to you and to us; advise  then  with yourself; though  indeed  there is no longer time for advising--your resolve should be already made. and there is but one plan; for in the following night the whole must be accomplished. if we delay  it will be impossible and no longer practicable. by all means  therefore  socrates  be persuaded by me  and on no account refuse.  6.  socr.  my dear crito  your zeal would be very commendable were it united with right principle; otherwise  by how much the more earnest it is  by so much is it the more sad. we must consider  therefore  whether this plan should be adopted or not. for i not now only  but always  am a person who will obey nothing within me but reason  according as it appears to me on mature deliberation to be best. and the reasons which i formerly professed i can not now reject  because this misfortune has befallen me; but they appear to me in much the same light  and i respect and honor them as before; so that if we are unable to adduce any better at the present time  be assured that i shall not give in to you  even though the power of the multitude should endeavor to terrify us like children  by threatening more than it does now  bonds and death  and confiscation of property. how  therefore  may we consider the matter most conveniently? first of all  if we recur to the argument which you used about opinions  whether on former occasions it was rightly resolved or not  that we ought to pay attention to some opinions  and to others not; or whether  before it was necessary that i should die  it was rightly resolved; but now it has become clear that it was said idly for argument s sake  though in reality it was merely jest and trifling. i desire then  crito  to consider  in common with you  whether it will appear to me in a different light  now that i am in this condition  or the same  and whether we shall give it up or yield to it. it was said  i think  on former occasions  by those who were thought to speak seriously  as i just now observed  that of the opinions which men entertain some should be very highly esteemed and others not. by the gods! crito  does not this appear to you to be well said? for you  in all human probability  are out of all danger of dying to-morrow  and the present calamity will not lead your judgment astray. consider  then; does it not appear to you to have been rightly settled that we ought not to respect all the opinions of men  but some we should  and others not? nor yet the opinions of all men  but of some we should  and of others not? what say you? is not this rightly resolved?   cri.  it is.   socr.  therefore we should respect the good  but not the bad?   cri.  yes.   socr.  and are not the good those of the wise  and the bad those of the foolish?   cri.  how can it be otherwise?  7.  socr.  come  then: how  again  were the following points settled? does a man who practices gymnastic exercises and applies himself to them  pay attention to the praise and censure and opinion of every one  or of that one man only who happens to be a physician  or teacher of the exercises?   cri.  of that one only.   socr.  he ought  therefore  to fear the censures and covet the praises of that one  but not those of the multitude.   cri.  clearly.   socr.  he ought  therefore  so to practice and exercise himself  and to eat and drink  as seems fitting to the one who presides and knows  rather than to all others together.   cri.  it is so.   socr.  well  then  if he disobeys the one  and disregards his opinion and praise  but respects that of the multitude and of those who know nothing  will he not suffer some evil?   cri.  how should he not?   socr.  but what is this evil? whither does it tend  and on what part of him that disobeys will it fall?   cri.  clearly on his body  for this it ruins.   socr.  you say well. the case is the same  too  crito  with all other things  not to go through them all. with respect then  to things just and unjust  base and honorable  good and evil  about which we are now consulting  ought we to follow the opinion of the multitude  and to respect it  or that of one  if there is any one who understands  whom we ought to reverence and respect rather than all others together? and if we do not obey him  shall we not corrupt and injure that part of ourselves which becomes better by justice  but is ruined by injustice? or is this nothing?   cri.  i agree with you  socrates.  8.  socr.  come  then  if we destroy that which becomes better by what is wholesome  but is impaired by what is unwholesome  through being persuaded by those who do not understand  can we enjoy life when that is impaired? and this is the body we are speaking of  is it not?   cri.  yes.   socr.  can we  then  enjoy life with a diseased and impaired body?   cri.  by no means.   socr.  but can we enjoy life when that is impaired which injustice ruins but justice benefits? or do we think that to be of less value than the body  whatever part of us it may be  about which injustice and justice are concerned    cri.  by no means.   socr.  but of more value?   cri.  much more.   socr.  we must not then  my excellent friend  so much regard what the multitude will say of us  but what he will say who understands the just and the unjust  the one  even truth itself. so that at first you did not set out with a right principle  when you laid it down that we ought to regard the opinion of the multitude with respect to things just and honorable and good  and their contraries. how ever  some one may say  are not the multitude able to put us to death?   cri.  this  too  is clear  socrates  any one might say so.   socr.  you say truly. but  my admirable friend  this principle which we have just discussed appears to me to be the same as it was before. and consider this  moreover  whether it still holds good with us or not  that we are not to be anxious about living but about living well.   cri.  it does hold good.   socr.  and does this hold good or not  that to live well and honorable and justly are the same thing?   cri.  it does.  9.  socr.  from what has been admitted  then  this consideration arises  whether it is just or not that i should endeavor to leave this place without the permission of the athenians. and should it appear to be just  we will make the attempt  but if not  we will give it up. but as to the considerations which you mention  of an outlay of money  reputation  and the education of children  beware  crito  lest such considerations as these in reality belong to these multitudes  who rashly put one to death  and would restore one to life  if they could do so  without any reason at all. but we  since reason so requires  must consider nothing else than what we just now mentioned  whether we shall act justly in paying money and contracting obligations to those who will lead me hence  as well they who lead me as we who are led hence  or whether  in truth  we shall not act unjustly in doing all these things. and if we should appear in so doing to be acting unjustly  observe that we must not consider whether from remaining here and continuing quiet we must needs die  or suffer any thing else  rather than whether we shall be acting unjustly.   cri.  you appear to me to speak wisely  socrates  but see what we are to do.   socr.  let us consider the matter together  my friend  and if you have any thing to object to what i say  make good your objection  and i will yield to you  but if not  cease  my excellent friend  to urge upon me the same thing so often  that i ought to depart hence against the will of the athenians. for i highly esteem your endeavors to persuade me thus to act  so long as it is not against my will consider  then  the beginning of our inquiry  whether it is stated to your entire satisfaction  and endeavor to answer the question put to you exactly as you think right.   cri.  i will endeavor to do so.  10.  socr.  say we  then  that we should on no account deliberately commit injustice  or may we commit injustice under certain circumstances  under others not? or is it on no account either good or honorable to commit injustice  as we have often agreed on former occasions  and as we just now said? or have all those our former admissions been dissipated in these few days  and have we  crito  old men as we are  been for a long time seriously conversing with each other without knowing that we in no respect differ from children? or does the case  beyond all question  stand as we then determined? whether the multitude allow it or not  and whether we must suffer a more severe or a milder punishment than this  still is injustice on every account both evil and disgraceful to him who commits it? do we admit this  or not?   cri.  we do admit it.   socr.  on no account  therefore  ought we to act unjustly.   cri.  surely not.   socr.  neither ought one who is injured to return the injury  as the multitude think  since it is on no account right to act unjustly.   cri.  it appears not.   socr.  what  then? is it right to do evil  crito  or not?   cri.  surely it is not right  socrates.   socr.  but what? to do evil in return when one has been evil-entreated  is that right  or not?   cri.  by no means.   socr.  for to do evil to men differs in no respect from committing injustice.   cri.  you say truly.   socr.  it is not right  therefore  to return an injury  or to do evil to any man  however one may have suffered from him. but take care  crito  that in allowing these things you do not allow them contrary to your opinion  for i know that to some few only these things both do appear  and will appear  to be true. they  then  to whom these things appear true  and they to whom they do not  have no sentiment in common  and must needs despise each other  while they look to each other s opinions. consider well  then  whether you coincide and think with me  and whether we can begin our deliberations from this point--that it is never right either to do an injury or to return an injury  or when one has been evil-entreated  to revenge one s self by doing evil in return  or do you dissent from  and not coincide in this principle? for so it appears to me  both long since and now  but if you in any respect think otherwise  say so and inform me. but if you persist in your former opinions  hear what follows.   cri.  i do persist in them  and think with you. speak on  then.   socr.  i say next  then  or rather i ask; whether when a man has promised to do things that are just he ought to do them  or evade his promise?   cri.  he ought to do them.  11.  socr.  observe  then  what follows. by departing hence without the leave of the city  are we not doing evil to some  and that to those to whom we ought least of all to do it  or not? and do we abide by what we agreed on as being just  or do we not?   cri.  i am unable to answer your question  socrates; for i do not understand it.   socr.  then  consider it thus. if  while we were preparing to run away  or by whatever name we should call it  the laws and commonwealth should come  and  presenting themselves before us  should say  \"tell me  socrates  what do you purpose doing? do you design any thing else by this proceeding in which you are engaged than to destroy us  the laws  and the whole city  so far as you are able? or do you think it possible for that city any longer to subsist  and not be subverted  in which judgments that are passed have no force  but are set aside and destroyed by private persons?\"--what should we say  crito  to these and similar remonstrances? for any one  especially an orator  would have much to say on the violation of the law  which enjoins that judgments passed shall be enforced. shall we say to them that the city has done us an injustice  and not passed a right sentence? shall we say this  or what else?   cri.  this  by jupiter! socrates.  12.  socr.  what  then  if the laws should say  \"socrates  was it not agreed between us that you should abide by the judgments which the city should pronounce?\" and if we should wonder at their speaking thus  perhaps they would say  \"wonder not  socrates  at what we say  but answer  since you are accustomed to make use of questions and answers. for  come  what charge have you against us and the city  that you attempt to destroy us? did we not first give you being? and did not your father  through us  take your mother to wife and beget you? say  then  do you find fault with those laws among us that relate to marriage as being bad?\" i should say  \"i do not find fault with them.\" \"do you with those that relate to your nurture when born  and the education with which you were instructed? or did not the laws  ordained on this point  enjoin rightly  in requiring your father to instruct you in music and gymnastic exercises?\" i should say  rightly. well  then  since you were born  nurtured  and educated through our means  can you say  first of all  that you are not both our offspring and our slave  as well you as your ancestors? and if this be so  do you think that there are equal rights between us? and whatever we attempt to do to you  do you think you may justly do to us in turn? or had you not equal rights with your father  or master  if you happened to have one  so as to return what you suffered  neither to retort when found fault with  nor  when stricken  to strike again  nor many other things of the kind; but that with your country and the laws you may do so; so that if we attempt to destroy you  thinking it to be just  you also should endeavor  so far as you are able  in return  to destroy us  the laws  and your country; and in doing this will you say that you act justly--you who  in reality  make virtue your chief object? or are you so wise as not to know that one s country is more honorable  venerable  and sacred  and more highly prized both by gods  and men possessed of understanding  than mother and father  and all other progenitors; and that one ought to reverence  submit to  and appease one s country  when angry  rather than one s father; and either persuade it or do what it orders  and to suffer quietly if it bids one suffer  whether to be beaten  or put in bonds; or if it sends one out to battle there to be wounded or slain  this must be done; for justice so requires  and one must not give way  or retreat  or leave one s post; but that both in war and in a court of justice  and everywhere one must do what one s city and country enjoin  or persuade it in such manner as justice allows; but that to offer violence either to one s mother or father is not holy  much less to one s country? what shall we say to these things  crito? that the laws speak the truth  or not?   cri.  it seems so to me.  13.  socr.  \"consider  then  socrates \" the laws perhaps might say  \"whether we say truly that in what you are now attempting you are attempting to do what is not just toward us. for we  having given you birth  nurtured  instructed you  and having imparted to you and all other citizens all the good in our power  still proclaim  by giving the power to every athenian who pleases  when he has arrived at years of discretion  and become acquainted with the business of the state  and us  the laws  that any one who is not satisfied with us may take his property  and go wherever he pleases. and if any one of you wishes to go to a colony  if he is not satisfied with us and the city  or to migrate and settle in another country  none of us  the laws  hinder or forbid him going whithersoever he pleases  taking with him all his property. but whoever continues with us after he has seen the manner in which we administer justice  and in other respects govern the city  we now say that he has in fact entered into a compact with us to do what we order; and we affirm that he who does not obey is in three respects guilty of injustice--because he does not obey us who gave him being  and because he does not obey us who nurtured him  and because  having made a compact that he would obey us  he neither does so  nor does he persuade us if we do any thing wrongly; though we propose for his consideration  and do not rigidly command him to do what we order  but leave him the choice of one of two things  either to persuade us  or to do what we require  and yet he does neither of these.\"  14. \"and we say that you  o socrates! will be subject to these charges if you accomplish your design  and that not least of the athenians  but most so of all.\" and if i should ask  \"for what reason?\" they would probably justly retort on me by saying that  among all the athenians  i especially made this compact with them. for they would say  \"socrates  we have strong proof of this  that you were satisfied both with us and the city; for  of all the athenians  you especially would never have dwelt in it if it had not been especially agreeable to you; for you never went out of the city to any of the public spectacles  except once to the isthmian games  nor anywhere else  except on military service  nor have you ever gone abroad as other men do  nor had you ever had any desire to become acquainted with any other city or other laws  but we and our city were sufficient for you; so strongly were you attached to us  and so far did you consent to submit to our government  both in other respects and in begetting children in this city  in consequence of your being satisfied with it. moreover  in your very trial  it was in your power to have imposed on yourself a sentence of exile  if you pleased  and might then have done  with the consent of the city  what you now attempt against its consent. then  indeed  you boasted yourself as not being grieved if you must needs die; but you preferred  as you said  death to exile. now  however  you are neither ashamed of those professions  nor do you revere us  the laws  since you endeavor to destroy us  and you act as the vilest slave would act  by endeavoring to make your escape contrary to the conventions and the compacts by which you engaged to submit to our government. first  then  therefore  answer us this  whether we speak the truth or not in affirming that you agreed to be governed by us in deed  though not in word?\" what shall we say to this  crito? can we do otherwise than assent?   cri.  we must needs do so  socrates.   socr.  \"what else  then \" they will say  \"are you doing but violating the conventions and compacts which you made with us  though you did not enter into them from compulsion or through deception  or from being compelled to determine in a short time but during the space of seventy years  in which you might have departed if you had been dissatisfied with us  and the compacts had not appeared to you to be just? you  however  preferred neither lacedæmon nor crete  which you several times said are governed by good laws  nor any other of the grecian or barbarian cities; but you have been less out of athens than the lame and the blind  and other maimed persons. so much  it is evident  were you satisfied with the city and us  the laws  beyond the rest of the athenians; for who can be satisfied with a city without laws? but now will you not abide by your compacts? you will  if you are persuaded by us  socrates  and will not make yourself ridiculous by leaving the city.\"  15. \"for consider  by violating these compacts and offending against any of them  what good you will do to yourself or your friends. for that your friends will run the risk of being themselves banished  and deprived of the rights of citizenship  or of forfeiting their property  is pretty clear. and as for yourself  if you should go to one of the neighboring cities  either thebes or megara  for both are governed by good laws  you will go there  socrates  as an enemy to their polity; and such as have any regard for their country will look upon you with suspicion  regarding you as a corrupter of the laws; and you will confirm the opinion of the judges  so that they will appear to have condemned you rightly  for whose is a corrupter of the laws will appear in all likelihood to be a corrupter of youths and weak-minded men. will you  then  avoid these well-governed cities  and the best-ordered men? and should you do so  will it be worth your while to live? or will you approach them  and have the effrontery to converse with them  socrates  on subjects the same as you did here--that virtue and justice  legal institutions and laws  should be most highly valued by men? and do you not think that this conduct of socrates would be very indecorous? you must think so. but you will keep clear of these places  and go to thessaly  to crito s friends  for there are the greatest disorder and licentiousness; and perhaps they will gladly hear you relating how drolly you escaped from prison  clad in some dress or covered with a skin  or in some other disguise such as fugitives are wont to dress themselves in  having so changed your usual appearance. and will no one say that you  though an old man  with but a short time to live  in all probability  have dared to have such a base desire of life as to violate the most sacred laws? perhaps not  should you not offend any one. but if you should  you will hear  socrates  many things utterly unworthy of you. you will live  too  in a state of abject dependence on all men  and as their slave. but what will you do in thessaly besides feasting  as if you had gone to thessaly to a banquet? and what will become of those discourses about justice and all other virtues? but do you wish to live for the sake of your children  that you may rear and educate them? what then? will you take them to thessaly  and there rear and educate them  making them aliens to their country  that they may owe you this obligation too? or  if not so  being reared here  will they be better reared and educated while you are living  though not with them  for your friends will take care of them? whether  if you go to thessaly  will they take care of them  but if you go to hades will they not take care of them? if  however  any advantage is to be derived from those that say they are your friends  we must think they will.\"  16. \"then  o socrates! be persuaded by us who have nurtured you  and do not set a higher value on your children  or on life  or on any thing else than justice  that  when you arrive in hades  you may have all this to say in your defense before those who have dominion there. for neither here in this life  if you do what is proposed  does it appear to be better  or more just  or more holy to yourself  or any of your friends; nor will it be better for you when you arrive there. but now you depart  if you do depart  unjustly treated  not by us  the laws  but by men; but should you escape  having thus disgracefully returned injury for injury  and evil for evil  having violated your own compacts and conventions which you made with us  and having done evil to those to whom you least of all should have done it--namely  yourself  your friends  your country  and us--both we shall be indignant with you as long as you live  and there our brothers  the laws in hades  will not receive you favorably knowing that you attempted  so far as you were able  to destroy us. let not crito  then  persuade you to do what he advises  rather than we.\"  17. these things  my dear friend crito  be assured  i seem to hear as the votaries of cybele seem to hear the flutes. and the sound of these words booms in my ear  and makes me incapable of hearing any thing else. be sure  then  so long as i retain my present opinions  if you should say any thing contrary to these  you will speak in vain. if  however  you think that you can prevail at all  say on.   cri.  but  socrates  i have nothing to say.   socr.  desist  then  crito  and let us pursue this course  since this way the deity leads us.  phædo; or  the immortality of the soul.   first echecrates  phædo. then socrates  apollodorus  cebes  simmias  and crito.   ech.  were you personally present  phædo  with socrates on that day when he drank the poison in prison  or did you hear an account of it from some one else?   phæd.  i was there myself  echecrates.   ech.  what  then  did he say before his death  and how did he die? for i should be glad to hear: for scarcely any citizen of phlius ever visits athens now  nor has any stranger for a long time come from thence who was able to give us a clear account of the particulars  except that he had died from drinking poison; but he was unable to tell us any thing more.  2.  phæd.  and did you not hear about the trial--how it went off?   ech.  yes; some one told me this; and i wondered that  as it took place so long ago  he appears to have died long afterward. what was the reason of this  phædo?   phæd.  an accidental circumstance happened in his favor  echecrates; for the poop of the ship which the athenians send to delos chanced to be crowned on the day before the trial.   ech.  but what is this ship?   phæd.  it is the ship  as the athenians say  in which theseus formerly conveyed the fourteen boys and girls to crete  and saved both them and himself. they  therefore  made a vow to apollo on that occasion  as it is said  that if they were saved they would every year dispatch a solemn embassy to delos; which  from that time to the present  they send yearly to the god. 3. when they begin the preparations for this solemn embassy  they have a law that the city shall be purified during this period  and that no public execution shall take place until the ship has reached delos  and returned to athens; and this occasionally takes a long time  when the winds happen to impede their passage. the commencement of the embassy is when the priest of apollo has crowned the poop of the ship. and this was done  as i said  on the day before the trial: on this account socrates had a long interval in prison between the trial and his death.  4.  ech.  and what  phædo  were the circumstances of his death? what was said and done? and who of his friends were with him? or would not the magistrates allow them to be present  but did he die destitute of friends?   phæd.  by no means; but some  indeed several  were present.   ech.  take the trouble  then  to relate to me all the particulars as clearly as you can  unless you have any pressing business.   phæd.  i am at leisure  and will endeavor to give you a full account; for to call socrates to mind  whether speaking myself or listening to some one else  is always most delightful to me.  5.  ech.  and indeed  phædo  you have others to listen to you who are of the same mind. however  endeavor to relate every thing as accurately as you can.   phæd.  i was  indeed  wonderfully affected by being present  for i was not impressed with a feeling of pity  like one present at the death of a friend; for the man appeared to me to be happy  echecrates  both from his manner and discourse  so fearlessly and nobly did he meet his death: so much so  that it occurred to me that in going to hades he was not going without a divine destiny  but that when he arrived there he would be happy  if any one ever was. for this reason i was entirely uninfluenced by any feeling of pity  as would seem likely to be the case with one present on so mournful an occasion; nor was i affected by pleasure from being engaged in philosophical discussions  as was our custom; for our conversation was of that kind. but an altogether unaccountable feeling possessed me  a kind of unusual mixture compounded of pleasure and pain together  when i considered that he was immediately about to die. and all of us who were present were affected in much the same manner  at one time laughing  at another weeping--one of us especially  apollodorus  for you know the man and his manner.   ech.  how should i not?  6.  phæd.  he  then  was entirely overcome by these emotions; and i  too  was troubled  as well as the others.   ech.  but who were present  phædo?   phæd.  of his fellow-countrymen  this apollodorus was present  and critobulus  and his father  crito; moreover  hermogenes  epigenes  æschines and antisthenes; ctesippus the pæanian  menexenus  and some others of his countrymen  were also there: plato  i think  was sick.   ech.  were any strangers present?   phæd.  yes; simmias  the theban  cebes and phædondes; and from megara  euclides and terpsion.  7.  ech.  but what! were not aristippus and cleombrotus present?   phæd.  no  for they were said to be at ægina.   ech.  was any one else there?   phæd.  i think that these were nearly all who were present.   ech.  well  now  what do you say was the subject of conversation?   phæd.  i will endeavor to relate the whole to you from the beginning. on the preceding days i and the others were constantly in the habit of visiting socrates  meeting early in the morning at the court house where the trial took place  for it was near the prison. 8. here  then  we waited every day till the prison was opened  conversing with each other  for it was not opened very early; but as soon as it was opened we went in to socrates  and usually spent the day with him. on that occasion  however  we met earlier than usual; for on the preceding day  when we left the prison in the evening  we heard that the ship had arrived from delos. we therefore urged each other to come as early as possible to the accustomed place. accordingly we came; and the porter  who used to admit us  coming out  told us to wait  and not to enter until he had called us. \"for \" he said  \"the eleven are now freeing socrates from his bonds  and announcing to him that he must die to-day.\" but in no long time he returned  and bade us enter.  9. when we entered  we found socrates just freed from his bonds  and xantippe  you know her  holding his little boy  and sitting by him. as soon as xantippe saw us she wept aloud  and said such things as women usually do on such occasions--as  \"socrates  your friends will now converse with you for the last time  and you with them.\" but socrates  looking towards crito  said: \"crito  let some one take her home.\" upon which some of crito s attendants led her away  wailing and beating herself.  but socrates  sitting up in bed  drew up his leg  and rubbed it with his hand  and as he rubbed it  said: \"what an unaccountable thing  my friends  that seems to be  which men call pleasure! and how wonderfully is it related toward that which appears to be its contrary  pain  in that they will not both be present to a man at the same time! yet if any one pursues and attains the one  he is almost always compelled to receive the other  as if they were both united together from one head.\"  10. \"and it seems tome \" he said  \"that if æsop had observed this he would have made a fable from it  how the deity  wishing to reconcile these warring principles  when he could not do so  united their heads together  and from hence whomsoever the one visits the other attends immediately after; as appears to be the case with me  since i suffered pain in my leg before from the chain  but now pleasure seems to have succeeded.\"  hereupon cebes  interrupting him  said: \"by jupiter! socrates  you have done well in reminding me; with respect to the poems which you made  by putting into metre those fables of æsop and the hymn to apollo  several other persons asked me  and especially evenus recently  with what design you made them after you came here  whereas before you had never made any. 11. if therefore  you care at all that i should be able to answer evenus  when he asks me again--for i am sure he will do so--tell me what i must say to him.\"  \"tell him the truth  then  cebes \" he replied  \"that i did not make them from a wish to compete with him  or his poems  for i knew that this would be no easy matter; but that i might discover the meaning of certain dreams  and discharge my conscience  if this should happen to be the music which they have often ordered me to apply myself to. for they were to the following purport: often in my past life the same dream visited me  appearing at different times in different forms  yet always saying the same thing-- socrates   it said   apply yourself to and practice music.  12. and i formerly supposed that it exhorted and encouraged me to continue the pursuit i was engaged in  as those who cheer on racers  so that the dream encouraged me to continue the pursuit i was engaged in--namely  to apply myself to music  since philosophy is the highest music  and i was devoted to it. but now since my trial took place  and the festival of the god retarded my death  it appeared to me that if by chance the dream so frequently enjoined me to apply myself to popular music  i ought not to disobey it  but do so  for that it would be safer for me not to depart hence before i had discharged my conscience by making some poems in obedience to the dream. thus  then  i first of all composed a hymn to the god whose festival was present; and after the god  considering that a poet  if he means to be a poet  ought to make fables  and not discourses  and knowing that i was not skilled in making fables  i therefore put into verse those fables of æsop  which were at hand  and were known to me  and which first occurred to me.\"  13. \"tell this  then  to evenus  cebes  and bid him farewell  and if he is wise  to follow me as soon as he can. but i depart  as it seems  to-day; for so the athenians order.\"  to this simmias said  \"what is this  socrates  which you exhort evenus to do? for i often meet with him; and  from what i know of him  i am pretty certain that he will not at all be willing to comply with your advice.\"  \"what  then \" said he  \"is not evenus a philosopher?\"  \"to me he seems to be so \" said simmias.  \"then he will be willing \" rejoined socrates  \"and so will every one who worthily engages in this study. perhaps  indeed  he will not commit violence on himself; for that  they say  is not allowable.\" and as he said this he let down his leg from the bed on the ground  and in this posture continued during the remainder of the discussion.  cebes then asked him  \"what do you mean  socrates  by saying that it is not lawful to commit violence on one s self  but that a philosopher should be willing to follow one who is dying?\"  14. \"what  cebes! have not you and simmias  who have conversed familiarly with philolaus on this subject  heard?\"  \"nothing very clearly  socrates.\"  \"i  however  speak only from hearsay; what  then  i have heard i have no scruple in telling. and perhaps it is most becoming for one who is about to travel there to inquire and speculate about the journey thither  what kind we think it is. what else can one do in the interval before sunset?\"  \"why  then  socrates  do they say that it is not allowable to kill one s self? for i  as you asked just now  have heard both philolaus  when he lived with us  and several others  say that it was not right to do this; but i never heard any thing clear upon the subject from any one.\"  15. \"then  you should consider it attentively \" said socrates  \"for perhaps you may hear. probably  however  it will appear wonderful to you  if this alone  of all other things  is a universal truth  and it never happens to a man  as is the case in all other things  that at some times and to some persons only it is better to die than to live; yet that these men for whom it is better to die--this probably will appear wonderful to you--may not without impiety do this good to themselves  but must await another benefactor.\"  16. then cebes  gently smiling  said  speaking in his own dialect  \"jove be witness!\"  \"and  indeed \" said socrates  \"it would appear to be unreasonable; yet still  perhaps  it has some reason on its side. the maxim  indeed  given on this subject in the mystical doctrines  that we men are in a kind of prison  and that we ought not to free ourselves from it and escape  appears to me difficult to be understood  and not easy to penetrate. this  however  appears to me  cebes  to be well said: that the gods take care of us  and that we men are one of their possessions. does it not seem so to you?\"  \"it does \" replied cebes.  \"therefore \" said he  \"if one of your slaves were to kill himself  without your having intimated that you wished him to die  should you not be angry with him  and should you not punish him if you could?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  \"perhaps  then  in this point of view  it is not unreasonable to assert that a man ought not to kill himself before the deity lays him under a necessity of doing so  such as that now laid on me.\"  17. \"this  indeed \" said cebes  \"appears to be probable. but what you said just now  socrates  that philosophers should be very willing to die  appears to be an absurdity  if what we said just now is agreeable to reason--that it is god who takes care of us  and that we are his property. for that the wisest men should not be grieved at leaving that service in which they govern them who are the best of all masters--namely  the gods--is not consistent with reason; for surely he can not think that he will take better care of himself when he has become free. but a foolish man might perhaps think thus  that he should fly from his master  and would not reflect that he ought not to fly from a good one  but should cling to him as much as possible; therefore he would fly against all reason; but a man of sense would desire to be constantly with one better than himself. thus  socrates  the contrary of what you just now said is likely to be the case; for it becomes the wise to be grieved at dying  but the foolish to rejoice.\"  18. socrates  on hearing this  appeared to me to be pleased with the pertinacity of cebes  and  looking toward us  said  \"cebes  you see  always searches out arguments  and is not at all willing to admit at once any thing one has said.\"  whereupon simmias replied  \"but  indeed  socrates  cebes appears to me now to say something to the purpose; for with what design should men really wise fly from masters who are better than themselves  and so readily leave them? and cebes appears to me to direct his argument against you  because you so easily endure to abandon both us and those good rulers  as you yourself confess  the gods.\"  \"you speak justly \" said socrates  \"for i think you mean that i ought to make my defense to this charge  as if i were in a court of justice.\"  \"certainly \" replied simmias.  19. \"come  then \" said he  \"i will endeavor to defend myself more successfully before you than before the judges. for \" he proceeded  \"simmias and cebes  if i did not think that i should go  first of all  among other deities who are both wise and good  and  next  among men who have departed this life  better than any here  i should be wrong in not grieving at death; but now  be assured  i hope to go among good men  though i would not positively assert it. that  however  i shall go among gods who are perfectly good masters  be assured i can positively assert this  if i can any thing of the kind. so that  on this account  i am not so much troubled  but i entertain a good hope that something awaits those who die  and that  as was said long since  it will be far better for the good than the evil.\"  20. \"what  then  socrates \" said simmias  \"would you go away keeping this persuasion to yourself  or would you impart it to us? for this good appears to me to be also common to us; and at the same time it will be an apology for you  if you can persuade us to believe what you say.\"  \"i will endeavor to do so \" he said. \"but first let us attend to crito here  and see what it is he seems to have for some time wished to say.\"  \"what else  socrates \" said crito  \"but what he who is to give you the poison told me some time ago  that i should tell you to speak as little as possible? for he says that men become too much heated by speaking  and that nothing of this kind ought to interfere with the poison; and that  otherwise  those who did so were sometimes compelled to drink two or three times.\"  to which socrates replied  \"let him alone  and let him attend to his own business  and prepare to give it me twice  or  if occasion require  even thrice.\"  21. \"i was almost certain what you would say \" answered crito  \"but he has been some time pestering me.\"  \"never mind him \" he rejoined.  \"but now i wish to render an account to you  my judges  of the reason why a man who has really devoted his life to philosophy  when he is about to die  appears to me  on good grounds  to have confidence  and to entertain a firm hope that the greatest good will befall him in the other world when he has departed this life. how  then  this comes to pass  simmias and cebes  i will endeavor to explain.\"  \"for as many as rightly apply themselves to philosophy seem to have left all others in ignorance  that they aim at nothing else than to die and be dead. if this  then  is true  it would surely be absurd to be anxious about nothing else than this during their whole life  but  when it arrives  to be grieved at what they have been long anxious about and aimed at.\"  22. upon this  simmias  smiling  said  \"by jupiter! socrates  though i am not now at all inclined to smile  you have made me do so; for i think that the multitude  if they heard this  would think it was very well said in reference to philosophers  and that our countrymen particularly would agree with you  that true philosophers do desire death  and that they are by no means ignorant that they deserve to suffer it.\"  \"and  indeed  simmias  they would speak the truth  except in asserting that they are not ignorant; for they are ignorant of the sense in which true philosophers desire to die  and in what sense they deserve death  and what kind of death. but \" he said  \"let us take leave of them  and speak to one another. do we think that death is any thing?\"  \"certainly \" replied simmias.  23. \"is it any thing else than the separation of the soul from the body? and is not this to die  for the body to be apart by itself separated from the soul  and for the soul to subsist apart by itself separated from the body? is death any thing else than this?\"  \"no  but this \" he replied.  \"consider  then  my good friend  whether you are of the same opinion as i; for thus  i think  we shall understand better the subject we are considering. does it appear to you to be becoming in a philosopher to be anxious about pleasures  as they are called  such as meats and drinks?\"  \"by no means  socrates \" said simmias.  \"but what? about the pleasures of love?\"  \"not at all.\"  24. \"what  then? does such a man appear to you to think other bodily indulgences of value? for instance  does he seem to you to value or despise the possession of magnificent garments and sandals  and other ornaments of the body except so far as necessity compels him to use them?\"  \"the true philosopher \" he answered  \"appears to me to despise them.\"  \"does not  then \" he continued  \"the whole employment of such a man appear to you to be  not about the body  but to separate himself from it as much as possible  and be occupied about his soul?\"  \"it does.\"  \"first of all  then  in such matters  does not the philosopher  above all other men  evidently free his soul as much as he can from communion with the body?\"  \"it appears so.\"  25. \"and it appears  simmias  to the generality of men  that he who takes no pleasure in such things  and who does not use them  does not deserve to live; but that he nearly approaches to death who cares nothing for the pleasures that subsist through the body.\"  \"you speak very truly.\"  \"but what with respect to the acquisition of wisdom? is the body an impediment  or not  if any one takes it with him as a partner in the search? what i mean is this: do sight and hearing convey any truth to men  or are they such as the poets constantly sing  who say that we neither hear nor see any thing with accuracy? if  however  these bodily senses are neither accurate nor clear  much less can the others be so; for they are all far inferior to these. do they not seem so to you?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  26. \"when  then \" said he  \"does the soul light on the truth? for when it attempts to consider any thing in conjunction with the body  it is plain that it is then led astray by it.\"  \"you say truly.\"  \"must it not  then  be by reasoning  if at all  that any of the things that really are become known to it?\"  \"yes.\"  \"and surely the soul then reasons best when none of these things disturb it--neither hearing  nor sight  nor pain  nor pleasure of any kind; but it retires as much as possible within itself  taking leave of the body; and  so far as it can  not communicating or being in contact with it  it aims at the discovery of that which is.\"  \"such is the case.\"  \"does not  then  the soul of the philosopher  in these cases  despise the body  and flee from it  and seek to retire within itself?\"  \"it appears so.\"  27. \"but what as to such things as these  simmias? do we say that justice itself is something or nothing?\"  \"we say it is something  by jupiter!\"  \"and that beauty and goodness are something?\"  \"how not?\"  \"now  then  have you ever seen any thing of this kind with your eyes?\"  \"by no means \" he replied.  \"did you ever lay hold of them by any other bodily sense? but i speak generally  as of magnitude  health  strength and  in a word  of the essence of every thing; that is to say  what each is. is  then  the exact truth of these perceived by means of the body  or is it thus  whoever among us habituates himself to reflect most deeply and accurately on each several thing about which he is considering  he will make the nearest approach to the knowledge of it?\"  \"certainly.\"  28. \"would not he  then  do this with the utmost purity  who should in the highest degree approach each subject by means of the mere mental faculties  neither employing the sight in conjunction with the reflective faculty  nor introducing any other sense together with reasoning; but who  using pure reflection by itself  should attempt to search out each essence purely by itself  freed as much as possible from the eyes and ears  and  in a word  from the whole body  as disturbing the soul  and not suffering it to acquire truth and wisdom  when it is in communion with it. is not he the person  simmias  if any one can  who will arrive at the knowledge of that which is?\"  29. \"you speak with wonderful truth  socrates \" replied simmias.  \"wherefore \" he said  \"it necessarily follows from all this that some such opinion as this should be entertained by genuine philosophers  so that they should speak among themselves as follows:  a by-path  as it were  seems to lead us on in our researches undertaken by reason   because so long as we are encumbered with the body  and our soul is contaminated with such an evil  we can never fully attain to what we desire; and this  we say  is truth. for the body subjects us to innumerable hinderances on account of its necessary support; and  moreover  if any diseases befall us  they impede us in our search after that which is; and it fills us with longings  desires  fears  all kinds of fancies  and a multitude of absurdities  so that  as it is said in real truth  by reason of the body it is never possible for us to make any advances in wisdom. 30. for nothing else than the body and its desires occasion wars  seditions  and contests; for all wars among us arise on account of our desire to acquire wealth: and we are compelled to acquire wealth on account of the body  being enslaved to its service; and consequently on all these accounts we are hindered in the pursuit of philosophy. but the worst of all is  that if it leaves us any leisure  and we apply ourselves to the consideration of any subject  it constantly obtrudes itself in the midst of our researches  and occasions trouble and disturbance  and confounds us so that we are not able  by reason of it  to discern the truth. it has  then  in reality been demonstrated to us that if we are ever to know any thing purely  we must be separated from the body  and contemplate the things themselves by the mere soul; and then  as it seems  we shall obtain that which we desire  and which we profess ourselves to be lovers of--wisdom--when we are dead  as reason shows  but not while we are alive. 31. for if it is not possible to know any thing purely in conjunction with the body  one of these two things must follow  either that we can never acquire knowledge  or only after we are dead; for then the soul will subsist apart by itself  separate from the body  but not before. and while we live we shall thus  as it seems  approach nearest to knowledge  if we hold no intercourse or communion at all with the body  except what absolute necessity requires  nor suffer ourselves to be polluted by its nature  but purify ourselves from it  until god himself shall release us. and thus being pure  and freed from the folly of body  we shall in all likelihood be with others like ourselves  and shall of ourselves know the whole real essence  and that probably is truth; for it is not allowable for the impure to attain to the pure. such things  i think  simmias  all true lovers of wisdom must both think and say to one another. does it not seem so to you?\"  \"most assuredly  socrates.\"  32. \"if this  then \" said socrates  \"is true  my friend  there is great hope for one who arrives where i am going  there  if anywhere  to acquire that in perfection for the sake of which we have taken so much pains during our past life; so that the journey now appointed me is set out upon with good hope  and will be so by any other man who thinks that his mind has been  as it were  purified.\"  \"certainly \" said simmias.  \"but does not purification consist in this  as was said in a former part of our discourse  in separating as much as possible the soul from the body  and in accustoming it to gather and collect itself by itself on all sides apart from the body  and to dwell  so far as it can  both now and hereafter  alone by itself  delivered  as it were  from the shackles of the body?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  33. \"is this  then  called death  this deliverance and separation of the soul from the body?\"  \"assuredly \" he answered.  \"but  as we affirmed  those who pursue philosophy rightly are especially and alone desirous to deliver it; and this is the very study of philosophers  the deliverance and separation of the soul from the body  is it not?\"  \"it appears so.\"  \"then  as i said at first  would it not be ridiculous for a man who has endeavored throughout his life to live as near as possible to death  then  when death arrives  to grieve? would not this be ridiculous?\"  \"how should it not?\"  \"in reality  then  simmias \" he continued  \"those who pursue philosophy rightly  study to die; and to them  of all men  death is least formidable. judge from this. since they altogether hate the body and desire to keep the soul by itself  would it not be irrational if  when this comes to pass  they should be afraid and grieve  and not be glad to go to that place where  on their arrival  they may hope to obtain that which they longed for throughout life? but they longed for wisdom  and to be freed from association with that which they hated. 34. have many of their own accord wished to descend into hades  on account of human objects of affection  their wives and sons  induced by this very hope of their seeing and being with those whom they have loved? and shall one who really loves wisdom  and firmly cherishes this very hope  that he shall nowhere else attain it in a manner worthy of the name  except in hades  be grieved at dying  and not gladly go there? we must think that he would gladly go  my friend  if he be in truth a philosopher; for he will be firmly persuaded of this  that he will nowhere else than there attain wisdom in its purity; and if this be so  would it not be very irrational  as i just now said  if such a man were to be afraid of death?\"  \"very much so  by jupiter!\" he replied.  35. \"would not this  then \" he resumed  \"be a sufficient proof to you with respect to a man whom you should see grieved when about to die  that he was not a lover of wisdom  but a lover of his body? and this same person is probably a lover of riches and a lover of honor  one or both of these.\"  \"it certainly is as you say \" he replied.  \"does not  then \" he said  \"that which is called fortitude  simmias  eminently belong to philosophers?\"  \"by all means \" he answered.  \"and temperance  also  which even the multitude call temperance  and which consists in not being carried away by the passions  but in holding them in contempt  and keeping them in subjection  does not this belong to those only who most despise the body  and live in the study of philosophy?\"  \"necessarily so \" he replied.  36. \"for \" he continued  \"if you will consider the fortitude and temperance of others  they will appear to you to be absurd.\"  \"how so  socrates?\"  \"do you know \" he said  \"that all others consider death among the great evils?\"  \"they do indeed \" he answered.  \"then  do the brave among them endure death when they do endure it  through dread of greater evils?\"  \"it is so.\"  \"all men  therefore  except philosophers  are brave through being afraid and fear; though it is absurd that any one should be brave through fear and cowardice.\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but what  are not those among them who keep their passions in subjection affected in the same way? and are they not temperate through a kind of intemperance? and although we may say  perhaps  that this is impossible  nevertheless the manner in which they are affected with respect to this silly temperance resembles this  for  fearing to be deprived of other pleasures  and desiring them  they abstain from some  being mastered by others. and though they call intemperance the being governed by pleasures  yet it happens to them that  by being mastered by some pleasures  they master others  and this is similar to what was just now said  that in a certain manner they become temperate through intemperance.\"  \"so it seems \"  37. \"my dear simmias  consider that this is not a right exchange for virtue  to barter pleasures for pleasures  pains for pains  fear for fear  and the greater for the lesser  like pieces of money  but that that alone is the right coin  for which we ought to barter all these things  wisdom  and for this and with this everything is in reality bought and sold fortitude  temperance and justice  and  in a word true virtue  subsist with wisdom  whether pleasures and fears  and everything else of the kind  are present or absent  but when separated from wisdom and changed one for another  consider whether such virtue is not a mere outline and in reality servile  possessing neither soundness nor truth. but the really true virtue is a purification from all such things  and temperance  justice  fortitude and wisdom itself  are a kind of initiatory purification 38. and those who instituted the mysteries for us appear to have been by no means contemptible  but in reality to have intimated long since that whoever shall arrive in hades unexpiated and uninitiated shall lie in mud  but he that arrives there purified and initiated shall dwell with the gods  for there are   say those who preside at the mysteries   many wand-bearers  but few inspired . these last  in my opinion  are no other than those who have pursued philosophy rightly that i might be of their number. i have to the utmost of my ability left no means untried  but have endeavored to the utmost of my power. but whether i have endeavored rightly  and have in any respect succeeded  on arriving there i shall know clearly  if it please god--very shortly  as it appears to me.\"  39. \"such  then  simmias and cebes \" he added  \"is the defense i make  for that i  on good grounds  do not repine or grieve at leaving you and my masters here  being persuaded that there  no less than here  i shall meet with good masters and friends. but to the multitude this is incredible if  however  i have succeeded better with you in my defense than i did with the athenian judges  it is well.\"  when socrates had thus spoken  cebes  taking up the discussion  said \"socrates  all the rest appears to me to be said rightly  but what you have said respecting the soul will occasion much incredulity in many from the apprehension that when it is separated from the body it no longer exists anywhere  but is destroyed and perishes on the very day in which a man dies  and that immediately it is separated and goes out from the body it is dispersed  and vanishes like breath or smoke  and is no longer anywhere  since if it remained anywhere united in itself  and freed from those evils which you have just now enumerated  there would be an abundant and good hope  socrates  that what you say is true 40. but this probably needs no little persuasion and proof  that the soul of a man who dies exists  and possesses activity and intelligence.\"  \"you say truly  cebes \" said socrates  \"but what shall we do? are you willing that we should converse on these points  whether such is probably the case or not?\"  \"indeed \" replied cebes  \"i should gladly hear your opinion on these matters.\"  \"i do not think \" said socrates  \"that any one who should now hear us  even though he were a comic poet  would say that i am talking idly  or discoursing on subjects that do not concern me. if you please  then  we will examine into it. let us consider it in this point of view  whether the souls of men who are dead exist in hades  or not. this is an ancient saying  which we now call to mind  that souls departing hence exist there  and return hither again  and are produced from the dead. 41. and if this is so  that the living are produced again from the dead  can there be any other consequence than that our souls are there? for surely they could not be produced again if they did not exist; and this would be sufficient proof that these things are so  if it should in reality be evident that the living are produced from no other source than the dead. but if this is not the case  there will be need of other arguments.\"  \"certainly \" said cebes.  \"you must not  then \" he continued  \"consider this only with respect to men  if you wish to ascertain it with greater certainty  but also with respect to all animals and plants  and  in a word  with respect to every thing that is subject to generation. let us see whether they are not all so produced  no otherwise than contraries from contraries  wherever they have any such quality; as  for instance  the honorable is contrary to the base  and the just to the unjust  and so with ten thousand other things. 42. let us consider this  then  whether it is necessary that all things which have a contrary should be produced from nothing else than their contrary. as  for instance  when any thing becomes greater  is it not necessary that  from being previously smaller  it afterward became greater?\"  \"yes.\"  \"and if it becomes smaller  will it not  from being previously greater  afterward become smaller?\"  \"it is so \" he replied.  \"and from stronger  weaker? and from slower  swifter?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"what  then? if any thing becomes worse  must it not become so from better? and if more just  from more unjust?\"  \"how should it not?\"  \"we have then \" he said  \"sufficiently determined this  that all things are thus produced  contraries from contraries?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"what next? is there also something of this kind in them; for instance  between all two contraries a mutual twofold production  from one to the other  and from that other back again? for between a greater thing and a smaller there are increase and decrease  and do we not accordingly call the one to increase  the other to decrease?\"  \"yes \" he replied.  43. \"and must not to be separated and commingled  to grow cold and to grow warm  and every thing in the same manner  even though sometimes we have not names to designate them  yet in fact be everywhere thus circumstanced  of necessity  as to be produced from each other  and be subject to a reciprocal generation?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  \"what  then?\" said socrates  \"has life any contrary  as waking has its contrary  sleeping?\"  \"certainly \" he answered.  \"what?\"  \"death \" he replied.  \"are not these  then  produced from each other  since they are contraries; and are not the modes by which they are produced two-fold intervening between these two?\"  \"how should it be otherwise?\"  \"i then \" continued socrates  \"will describe to you one pair of the contraries which i have just now mentioned  both what it is and its mode of production: and do you describe to me the other. i say that one is to sleep  the other to awake; and from sleeping awaking is produced  and from awaking sleeping  and that the modes of their production are  the one to fall asleep  the other to be roused. 44. have i sufficiently explained this to you or not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"do you  then \" he said  \"describe to me in the same manner with respect to life and death? do you not say that life is contrary to death?\"  \"i do.\"  \"and that they are produced from each other?\"  \"yes.\"  \"what  then  is produced from life?\"  \"death \" he replied.  \"what  then \" said he \"is produced from death?\"  \"i must needs confess \" he replied  \"that life is.\"  \"from the dead  then  o cebes! living things and living men are produced.\"  \"it appears so \" he said.  \"our souls  therefore \" said socrates  \"exist in hades.\"  \"so it seems.\"  \"with respect  then  to their mode of production  is not one of them very clear? for to die surely is clear  is it not?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  \"what  then  shall we do?\" he continued; \"shall we not find a corresponding contrary mode of production  or will nature be defective in this? or must we discover a contrary mode of production to dying?\"  \"by all means \" he said.  \"what is this?\"  \"to revive.\"  \"therefore \" he proceeded  \"if there is such a thing as to revive  will not this reviving be a mode of production from the dead to the living?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"thus  then  we have agreed that the living are produced from the dead  no less than the dead from the living; but  this being the case  there appears to me sufficient proof that the souls of the dead must necessarily exist somewhere  from whence they are again produced.\"  45. \"it appears to me  socrates \" he said \"that this must necessarily follow from what has been admitted.\"  \"see now  o cebes!\" he said  \"that we have not agreed on these things improperly  as it appears to me; for if one class of things were not constantly given back in the place of another  revolving  as it were  in a circle  but generation were direct from one thing alone into its opposite  and did not turn round again to the other  or retrace its course  do you know that all things would at length have the same form  be in the same state  and cease to be produced?\"  \"how say you?\" he asked.  \"it is by no means difficult \" he replied  \"to understand what i mean; if  for instance  there should be such a thing as falling asleep  but no reciprocal waking again produced from a state of sleep  you know that at length all things would show the fable of endymion to be a jest  and it would be thought nothing at all of  because everything else would be in the same state as he--namely  asleep. and if all things were mingled together  but never separated  that doctrine of anaxagoras would soon be verified   all things would be together.  46. likewise  my dear cebes  if all things that partake of life should die  and after they are dead should remain in this state of death  and not revive again  would it not necessarily follow that at length all things should be dead  and nothing alive? for if living beings are produced from other things  and living beings die  what could prevent their being all absorbed in death?\"  \"nothing whatever  i think  socrates \" replied cebes; \"but you appear to me to speak the exact truth.\"  \"for  cebes \" he continued  \"as it seems to me  such undoubtedly is the case  and we have not admitted these things under a delusion  for it is in reality true that there is a reviving again  that the living are produced from the dead  that the souls of the dead exist  and that the condition of the good is better  and of the evil worse.\"  47. \"and  indeed \" said cebes  interrupting him  \"according to that doctrine  socrates  which you are frequently in the habit of advancing  if it is true  that our learning is nothing else than reminiscence  according to this it is surely necessary that we must at some former time have learned what we now remember. but this is impossible  unless our soul existed somewhere before it came into this human form; so that from hence  also  the soul appears to be something immortal.\"  \"but  cebes \" said simmias  interrupting him  \"what proofs are there of these things? remind me of them  for i do not very well remember them at present.\"  48. \"it is proved \" said cebes  \"by one argument  and that a most beautiful one  that men  when questioned (if one questions them properly) of themselves  describe all things as they are  however  if they had not innate knowledge and right reason  they would never be able to do this. moreover  if one leads them to diagrams  or any thing else of the kind  it is then most clearly apparent that this is the case.\"  \"but if you are not persuaded in this way  simmias \" said socrates  \"see if you will agree with us in considering the matter thus. for do you doubt how that which is called learning is reminiscence?\"  \"i do not doubt \" said simmias; \"but i require this very thing of which we are speaking  to be reminded; and  indeed  from what cebes has begun to say  i almost now remember  and am persuaded; nevertheless  however  i should like to hear now how you would attempt to prove it.\"  \"i do it thus\" he replied: \"we admit  surely  that if any one be reminded of any thing  he must needs have known that thing at some time or other before.\"  \"certainly \" he said.  49. \"do we  then  admit this also  that when knowledge comes in a certain manner it is reminiscence? but the manner i mean is this: if any one  upon seeing or hearing  or perceiving through the medium of any other sense  some particular thing  should not only know that  but also form an idea of something else  of which the knowledge is not the same  but different  should we not justly say that he remembered that of which he received the idea?\"  \"how mean you?\"  \"for instance  the knowledge of a man is different from that of a lyre.\"  \"how not?\"  \"do you not know  then  that lovers when they see a lyre  or a garment  or any thing else which their favorite is accustomed to use  are thus affected; they both recognize the lyre  and receive in their minds the form of the person to whom the lyre belonged? this is reminiscence: just as any one  seeing simmias  is often reminded of cebes  and so in an infinite number of similar instances.\"  \"an infinite number  indeed  by jupiter!\" said simmias.  \"is not  then \" he said  \"something of this sort a kind of reminiscence  especially when one is thus affected with respect to things which  from lapse of time  and not thinking of them  one has now forgotten?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  50. \"but what?\" he continued. \"does it happen that when one sees a painted horse or a painted lyre one is reminded of a man  and that when one sees a picture of simmias one is reminded of cebes?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"and does it not also happen that on seeing a picture of simmias one is reminded of simmias himself?\"  \"it does  indeed \" he replied.  \"does it not happen  then  according to all this  that reminiscence arises partly from things like  and partly from things unlike?\"  \"it does.\"  \"but when one is reminded by things like  is it not necessary that one should be thus further affected  so as to perceive whether  as regards likeness  this falls short or not of the thing of which one has been reminded?\"  \"it is necessary \" he replied.  \"consider  then \" said socrates  \"if the case is thus. do we allow that there is such a thing as equality? i do not mean of one log with another  nor one stone with another  nor any thing else of this kind  but something altogether different from all these--abstract equality; do we allow that there is any such thing  or not?\"  \"by jupiter! we most assuredly do allow it \" replied simmias.  51. \"and do we know what it is itself?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  \"whence have we derived the knowledge of it? is it not from the things we have just now mentioned  and that from seeing logs  or stones  or other things of the kind  equal  we have from these formed an idea of that which is different from these--for does it not appear to you to be different? consider the matter thus. do not stones that are equal  and logs sometimes that are the same  appear at one time equal  and at another not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but what? does abstract equality ever appear to you unequal? or equality inequality?\"  \"never  socrates  at any time.\"  \"these equal things  then \" he said  \"and abstract equality  are not the same?\"  \"by no means  socrates  as it appears.\"  \"however  from these equal things \" he said  \"which are different from that abstract equality  have you not formed your idea and derived your knowledge of it?\"  \"you speak most truly \" he replied.  \"is it not  therefore  from its being like or unlike them?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but it makes no difference \" he said. \"when  therefore  on seeing one thing  you form  from the sight of it  the notion of another  whether like or unlike  this \" he said  \"must necessarily be reminiscence.\"  \"certainly.\"  52. \"what  then  as to this?\" he continued. \"are we affected in any such way with regard to logs and the equal things we have just now spoken of? and do they appear to us to be equal in the same manner as abstract equality itself is  or do they fall short in some degree  or not at all  of being such as equality itself is?\"  \"they fall far short \" he replied.  \"do we admit  then  that when one  on beholding some particular thing  perceives that it aims  as that which i now see  at being like something else that exists  but falls short of it  and can not become such as that is  but is inferior to it--do we admit that he who perceives this must necessarily have had a previous knowledge of that which he says it resembles  though imperfectly?\"  \"it is necessary.\"  \"what  then? are we affected in some such way  or not  with respect to things equal and abstract equality itself?\"  \"assuredly.\"  \"it is necessary  therefore  that we must have known abstract equality before the time when  on first seeing equal things  we perceived that they all aimed at resembling equality  but failed in doing so.\"  \"such is the case.\"  53. \"moreover  we admit this too  that we perceived this  and could not possibly perceive it by any other means than the sight  or touch  or some other of the senses  for i say the same of them all.\"  \"for they are the same  socrates  so far as  our argument is concerned.\"  \"however  we must perceive  by means of the senses  that all things which come under the senses aim at that abstract equality  and yet fall short of it; or how shall we say it is?\"  \"even so.\"  \"before  then  we began to see  and hear  and use our other senses  we must have had a knowledge of equality itself--what it is  if we were to refer to it those equal things that come under the senses  and observe that all such things aim at resembling that  but fall far short of it.\"  \"this necessarily follows  socrates  from what has been already said.\"  \"but did we not  as soon as we were born  see and hear  and possess our other senses?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but  we have said  before we possessed these  we must have had a knowledge of abstract equality?\"  \"yes.\"  \"we must have had it  then  as it seems  before we were born.\"  \"it seems so.\"  54. \"if  therefore  having this before we were born  we were born possessing it  we knew  both before we were born and as soon as we were born  not only the equal and the greater and smaller  but all things of the kind; for our present discussion is not more respecting equality than the beautiful itself  the good  the just  and the holy  and  in one word  respecting every thing which we mark with the seal of existence  both in the questions we ask and the answers we give. so that we must necessarily have had a knowledge of all these before we were born.\"  \"such is the case.\"  \"and if  having once had it  we did not constantly forget it  we should always be born with this knowledge  and should always retain it through life. for to know is this  when one has got a knowledge of any thing  to retain and not lose it; for do we not call this oblivion  simmias  the loss of knowledge?\"  \"assuredly  socrates \" he replied.  55. \"but if  having had it before we were born  we lose it at our birth  and afterward  through exercising the senses about these things  we recover the knowledge which we once before possessed  would not that which we call learning be a recovery of our own knowledge? and in saying that this is to remember  should we not say rightly?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"for this appeared to be possible  for one having perceived any thing  either by seeing or hearing  or employing any other sense  to form an idea of something different from this  which he had forgotten  and with which this was connected by being unlike or like. so that  as i said  one of these two things must follow: either we are all born with this knowledge  and we retain it through life  or those whom we say learn afterward do nothing else than remember  and this learning will be reminiscence.\"  \"such  certainly  is the case  socrates.\"  56. \"which  then  do you choose  simmias: that we are born with knowledge  or that we afterward remember what we had formerly known?\"  \"at present  socrates  i am unable to choose.\"  \"but what? are you able to choose in this case  and what do you think about it? can a man who possesses knowledge give a reason for the things that he knows  or not?\"  \"he needs must be able to do so  socrates \" he replied.  \"and do all men appear to you to be able to give a reason for the things of which we have just now been speaking?\"  \"i wish they could \" said simmias; \"but i am much more afraid that at this time to-morrow there will no longer be any one able to do this properly.\"  \"do not all men  then  simmias \" he said  \"seem to you to know these things?\"  \"by no means.\"  \"do they remember  then  what they once learned?\"  \"necessarily so.\"  \"when did our souls receive this knowledge? not surely  since we were born into the world.\"  \"assuredly not.\"  \"before  then?\"  \"yes.\"  \"our souls  therefore  simmias  existed before they were in a human form  separate from bodies  and possessed intelligence.\"  57. \"unless  socrates  we receive this knowledge at our birth  for this period yet remains.\"  \"be it so  my friend. but at what other time do we lose it? for we are not born with it  as we have just now admitted. do we lose it  then  at the very time in which we receive it? or can you mention any other time?\"  \"by no means  socrates; i was not aware that i was saying nothing to the purpose.\"  \"does the case then stand thus with us  simmias?\" he proceeded: \"if those things which we are continually talking about really exist  the beautiful  the good  and every such essence  and to this we refer all things that come under the senses  as finding it to have a prior existence  and to be our own  and if we compare these things to it  it necessarily follows  that as these exist  so likewise our soul exists even before we are born; but if these do not exist  this discussion will have been undertaken in vain  is it not so? and is there not an equal necessity both that these things should exist  and our souls also  before we are born; and if not the former  neither the latter?\"  58. \"most assuredly  socrates \" said simmias  \"there appears to me to be the same necessity; and the argument admirably tends to prove that our souls exist before we are born  just as that essence does which you have now mentioned. for i hold nothing so clear to me as this  that all such things most certainly exist  as the beautiful  the good  and all the rest that you just now spoke of; and  so far as i am concerned  the case is sufficiently demonstrated.\"  \"but how does it appear to cebes?\" said socrates; \"for it is necessary to persuade cebes too.\"  \"he is sufficiently persuaded  i think \" said simmias  \"although he is the most pertinacious of men in distrusting arguments. yet i think he is sufficiently persuaded of this  that our soul existed before we were born. but whether  when we are dead  it will still exist does not appear to me to have been demonstrated  socrates \" he continued; \"but that popular doubt  which cebes just now mentioned  still stands in our way  whether  when a man dies  the soul is not dispersed  and this is the end of its existence. 59. for what hinders it being born  and formed from some other source  and existing before it came into a human body  and yet  when it has come  and is separated from this body  its then also dying itself  and being destroyed?\"  \"you say well  simmias \" said cebes; \"for it appears that only one half of what is necessary has been demonstrated--namely  that our soul existed before we were born; but it is necessary to demonstrate further  that when we are dead it will exist no less than before we were born  if the demonstration is to be made complete.\"  \"this has been even now demonstrated  simmias and cebes \" said socrates  \"if you will only connect this last argument with that which we before assented to  that every thing living is produced from that which is dead. for if the soul exists before  and it is necessary for it when it enters into life  and is born  to be produced from nothing else than death  and from being dead  how is it not necessary for it also to exist after death  since it must needs be produced again? 60. what you require  then  has been already demonstrated. however  both you and simmias appear to me as if you wished to sift this argument more thoroughly  and to be afraid  like children  lest  on the soul s departure from the body  the winds should blow it away and disperse it  especially if one should happen to die  not in a calm  but in a violent storm.\"  upon this cebes  smiling  said  \"endeavor to teach us better  socrates  as if we were afraid  or rather not as if we were afraid  though perhaps there is some boy within us who has such a dread. let us  then  endeavor to persuade him not to be afraid of death  as of hobgoblins.\"  \"but you must charm him every day \" said socrates  \"until you have quieted his fears.\"  \"but whence  socrates \" he said  \"can we procure a skillful charmer for such a case  now that you are about to leave us?\"  61. \"greece is wide  cebes \" he replied  \"and in it surely there are skillful men. there are also many barbarous nations  all of which you should search through  seeking such a charmer  sparing neither money nor toil  as there is nothing on which you can more seasonably spend your money. you should also seek for him among yourselves; for perhaps you could not easily find any more competent than yourselves to do this.\"  \"this shall be done \" said cebes; \"but  if it is agreeable to you  let us return to the point from whence we digressed.\"  \"it will be agreeable to me  for how should it not?\"  \"you say well \" rejoined cebes.  \"we ought  then \" said socrates  \"to ask ourselves some such question as this: to what kind of thing it appertains to be thus affected--namely  to be dispersed--and for what we ought to fear  lest it should be so affected  and for what not. and after this we should consider which of the two the soul is  and in the result should either be confident or fearful for our soul.\"  \"you speak truly \" said he.  62. \"does it not  then  appertain to that which is formed by composition  and is naturally compounded  to be thus affected  to be dissolved in the same manner as that in which it was compounded; and if there is any thing not compounded  does it not appertain to this alone  if to any thing  not to be thus affected?\"  \"it appears to me to be so \" said cebes.  \"is it not most probable  then  that things which are always the same  and in the same state  are uncompounded  but that things which are constantly changing  and are never in the same state  are compounded?\"  \"to me it appears so.\"  \"let us return  then \" he said  \"to the subjects on which we before discoursed. whether is essence itself  of which we gave this account that it exists  both in our questions and answers  always the same  or does it sometimes change? does equality itself  the beautiful itself  and each several thing which is  ever undergo any change  however small? or does each of them which exists  being an unmixed essence by itself  continue always the same  and in the same state  and never undergo any variation at all under any circumstances?\"  \"they must of necessity continue the same and in the same state  socrates \" said cebes.  63. \"but what shall we say of the many beautiful things  such as men  horses  garments  or other things of the kind  whether equal or beautiful  or of all things synonymous with them? do they continue the same  or  quite contrary to the former  are they never at any time  so to say  the same  either with respect to themselves or one another?\"  \"these  on the other hand \" replied cebes  \"never continue the same.\"  \"these  then  you can touch  or see  or perceive by the other senses; but those that continue the same  you can not apprehend in any other way than by the exercise of thought; for such things are invisible  and are not seen?\"  \"you say what is strictly true \" replied cebes.  64. \"we may assume  then  if you please \" he continued  \"that there are two species of things; the one visible  the other invisible?\"  \"we may \" he said.  \"and the invisible always continuing the same  but the visible never the same?\"  \"this  too \" he said  \"we may assume.\"  \"come  then \" he asked  \"is there anything else belonging to us than  on the one hand  body  and  on the other  soul?\"  \"nothing else \" he replied.  \"to which species  then  shall we say the body is more like  and more nearly allied?\"  \"it is clear to everyone \" he said  \"that it is to the visible.\"  \"but what of the soul? is it visible or invisible?\"  \"it is not visible to men  socrates \" he replied.  \"but we speak of things which are visible  or not so  to the nature of men; or to some other nature  think you?\"  \"to that of men.\"  \"what  then  shall we say of the soul--that it is visible  or not visible?\"  \"not visible.\"  \"is it  then  invisible?\"  \"yes.\"  \"the soul  then  is more like the invisible than the body; and the body  the visible?\"  \"it must needs be so  socrates.\"  65. \"and did we not  some time since  say this too  that the soul  when it employs the body to examine any thing  either by means of the sight or hearing  or any other sense (for to examine any thing by means of the body is to do so by the senses)  is then drawn by the body to things that never continue the same  and wanders and is confused  and reels as if intoxicated  through coming into contact with things of this kind?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but when it examines anything by itself  does it approach that which is pure  eternal  immortal  and unchangeable  and  as being allied to it  continue constantly with it  so long as it subsists by itself  and has the power  and does it cease from its wandering  and constantly continue the same with respect to those things  through coming into contact with things of this kind? and is this affection of the soul called wisdom?\"  \"you speak \" he said  \"in every respect  well and truly  socrates.\"  \"to which species of the two  then  both from what was before and now said  does the soul appear to you to be more like and more nearly allied?\"  66. \"every one  i think  would allow  socrates \" he replied  \"even the dullest person  from this method of reasoning  that the soul is in every respect more like that which continues constantly the same than that which does not so.\"  \"but what as to the body?\"  \"it is more like the other.\"  \"consider it also thus  that  when soul and body are together  nature enjoins the latter to be subservient and obey  the former to rule and exercise dominion. and  in this way  which of the two appears to you to be like the divine  and which the mortal? does it not appear to you to be natural that the divine should rule and command  but the mortal obey and be subservient?\"  \"to me it does so.\"  \"which  then  does the soul resemble?\"  \"it is clear  socrates  that the soul resembles the divine; but the body  the mortal.\"  \"consider  then  cebes \" said he  \"whether  from all that has been said  these conclusions follow  that the soul is most like that which is divine  immortal  intelligent  uniform  indissoluble  and which always continues in the same state; but that the body  on the other hand  is most like that which is human  mortal  unintelligent  multiform  dissoluble  and which never continues in the same state. can we say any thing against this  my dear cebes  to show that it is not so?\"  \"we can not.\"  67. \"what  then? since these things are so  does it not appertain to the body to be quickly dissolved  but to the soul  on the contrary  to be altogether indissoluble or nearly so?\"  \"how not?\"  \"you perceive  however \" he said  \"that when a man dies  the visible part of him  the body  which is exposed to sight  and which we call a corpse  to which it appertains to be dissolved  to fall asunder and be dispersed  does not immediately undergo any of these affections  but remains for a considerable time  and especially so if any one should die with his body in full vigor  and at a corresponding age; for when the body has collapsed and been embalmed  as those that are embalmed in egypt  it remains almost entire for an incredible length of time; and some parts of the body  even though it does decay  such as the bones and nerves  and every thing of that kind  are  nevertheless  as one may say  immortal. is it not so?\"  \"yes.\"  68. \"can the soul  then  which is invisible  and which goes to another place like itself  excellent  pure and invisible  and therefore truly called the invisible world  to the presence of a good and wise god (whither  if god will  my soul also must shortly go)--can this soul of ours  i ask  being such and of such a nature  when separated from the body  be immediately dispersed and destroyed  as most men assert? far from it  my dear cebes and simmias. but the case is much rather thus: if it is separated in a pure state  taking nothing of the body with it  as not having willingly communicated with it in the present life  but having shunned it  and gathered itself within itself  as constantly studying this (but this is nothing else than to pursue philosophy aright  and in reality to study how to die easily)  would not this be to study how to die?\"  \"most assuredly.\"  \"does not the soul  then  when in this state  depart to that which resembles itself  the invisible  the divine  immortal and wise? and on its arrival there  is it not its lot to be happy  free from error  ignorance  fears  wild passions  and all the other evils to which human nature is subject; and  as is said of the initiated  does it not in truth pass the rest of its time with the gods? must we affirm that it is so  cebes  or otherwise?\"  \"so  by jupiter!\" said cebes.  69. \"but  i think  if it departs from the body polluted and impure  as having constantly held communion with the body  and having served and loved it  and been bewitched by it  through desires and pleasures  so as to think that there is nothing real except what is corporeal  which one can touch and see  and drink and eat  and employ for sensual purposes; but what is dark and invisible to the eyes  which is intellectual and apprehended by philosophy  having been accustomed to hate  fear  and shun this  do you think that a soul thus affected can depart from the body by itself  and uncontaminated?\"  \"by no means whatever \" he replied.  \"but i think it will be impressed with that which is corporeal  which the intercourse and communion of the body  through constant association and great attention  have made natural to it.\"  \"certainly.\"  \"we must think  my dear cebes  that this is ponderous and heavy  earthly and visible  by possessing which such a soul is weighed down  and drawn again into the visible world through dread of the invisible and of hades  wandering  as it is said  among monuments and tombs  about which  indeed  certain shadowy phantoms of souls have been seen  being such images as those souls produced which have not departed pure from the body  but which partake of the visible; on which account  also  they are visible.\"  \"that is probable  socrates.\"  70. \"probable indeed  cebes; and not that these are the souls of the good  but of the wicked  which are compelled to wander about such places  paying the penalty of their former conduct  which was evil; and they wander about so long until  through the desire of the corporeal nature that accompanies them  they are again united to a body; and they are united  as is probable  to animals having the same habits as those they have given themselves up to during life.\"  \"but what do you say these are  socrates?\"  \"for instance  those who have given themselves up to gluttony  wantonness and drinking  and have put no restraint on themselves  will probably be clothed in the form of asses and brutes of that kind. do you not think so?\"  \"you say what is very probable.\"  \"and that such as have set great value on injustice  tyranny and rapine  will be clothed in the species of wolves  hawks and kites! where else can we say such souls go?\"  \"without doubt \" said cebes  \"into such as these.\"  \"is it not  then  evident \" he continued  \"as to the rest  whither each will go  according to the resemblances of their several pursuits?\"  71. \"it is evident \" he replied. \"how not?\"  \"of these  then \" he said  \"are not they the most happy  and do they not go to the best place  who have practiced that social and civilized virtue which they call temperance and justice  and which is produced from habit and exercise  without philosophy and reflection?\"  \"in what respect are these the most happy?\"  \"because it is probable that these should again migrate into a corresponding civilized and peaceable kind of animals  such as bees perhaps  or wasps  or ants  or even into the same human species again  and from these become moderate men.\"  \"it is probable.\"  \"but it is not lawful for any one who has not studied philosophy  and departed this life perfectly pure  to pass into the rank of gods  but only for the true lover of wisdom. and on this account  my friends simmias and cebes  those who philosophize rightly  abstain from all bodily desires  and persevere in doing so  and do not give themselves up to them  not fearing the loss of property and poverty  as the generality of men and the lovers of wealth; nor  again  dreading disgrace and ignominy  like those who are lovers of power and honor  do they then abstain from them.\"  \"for it would not become them to do so  socrates \" says cebes.  72. \"it would not  by jupiter!\" he rejoined. \"wherefore  cebes  they who care at all for their soul  and do not spend their lives in the culture of their bodies  despising all these  proceed not in the same way with them  as being ignorant whither they are going  but  being convinced that they ought not to act contrary to philosophy  but in accordance with the freedom and purification she affords  they give themselves up to her direction  following her wherever she leads.\"  \"how  socrates?\"  \"i will tell you \" he replied. \"the lovers of wisdom know that philosophy  receiving their soul plainly bound and glued to the body  and compelled to view things through this  as through a prison  and not directly by herself  and sunk in utter ignorance  and perceiving  too  the strength of the prison  that it arises from desire  so that he who is bound as much as possible assists in binding himself. 73. i say  then  the lovers of wisdom know that philosophy  receiving their soul in this state  gently exhorts it  and endeavors to free it  by showing that the view of things by means of the eyes is full of deception  as also is that through the ears and the other senses; persuading an abandonment of these so far as it is not absolutely necessary to use them  and advising the soul to be collected and concentrated within itself  and to believe nothing else than herself  with respect to what she herself understands of things that have a real subsistence; and to consider nothing true which she views through the medium of others  and which differ under different aspects; for that a thing of this kind is sensible and visible  but that what she herself perceives is intelligible and invisible. the soul of the true philosopher  therefore  thinking that she ought not to oppose this deliverance  accordingly abstains as much as possible from pleasures and desires  griefs and fears  considering that when any one is exceedingly delighted or alarmed  grieved or influenced by desire  he does not merely suffer such evil from these things as one might suppose  such as either being sick or wasting his property through indulging his desires; but that which is the greatest evil  and the worst of all  this he suffers  and is not conscious of it.\"  \"but what is this evil  socrates?\" said cebes.  74. \"that the soul of every man is compelled to be either vehemently delighted or grieved about some particular thing  and  at the same time  to consider that the thing about which it is thus strongly affected is most real and most true  though it is not so. but these are chiefly visible objects  are they not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"in this state of affection  then  is not the soul especially shackled by the body?\"  \"how so?\"  \"because each pleasure and pain  having a nail  as it were  nails the soul to the body  and fastens it to it  and causes it to become corporeal  deeming those things to be true whatever the body asserts to be so. for  in consequence of its forming the same opinions with the body  and delighting in the same things  it is compelled  i think  to possess similar manners  and to be similarly nourished; so that it can never pass into hades in a pure state  but must ever depart polluted by the body  and so quickly falls again into another body  and grows up as if it were sown  and consequently is deprived of all association with that which is divine  and pure  and uniform.\"  \"you speak most truly  socrates \" said cebes.  75. \"for these reasons  therefore  cebes  those who are truly lovers of wisdom are moderate and resolute  and not for the reasons that most people say. do you think as they do?\"  \"assuredly not.\"  \"no  truly. but the soul of a philosopher would reason thus  and would not think that philosophy ought to set it free  and that when it is freed it should give itself up again to pleasures and pains  to bind it down again  and make her work void  weaving a kind of penelope s web the reverse way. on the contrary  effecting a calm of the passions  and following the guidance of reason  and being always intent on this  contemplating that which is true and divine  and not subject to opinion; and being nourished by it  it thinks that it ought to live in this manner as long as it does live  and that when it dies it shall go to a kindred essence  and one like itself  and shall be free from human evils. from such a regimen as this the soul has no occasion to fear  simmias and cebes  while it strictly attends to these things  lest  being torn to pieces at its departure from the body  it should be blown about and dissipated by the winds  and no longer have an existence anywhere.\"  76. when socrates had thus spoken  a long silence ensued; and socrates himself was pondering upon what had been said  as he appeared  and so did most of us; but cebes and simmias were conversing a little while with each other. at length socrates  perceiving them  said  \"what think you of what has been said? does it appear to you to have been proved sufficiently? for many doubts and objections still remain if any one will examine them thoroughly. if  then  you are considering some other subject  i have nothing to say; but if you are doubting about this  do not hesitate both yourselves to speak and express your opinion  if it appears to you in any respect that it might have been argued better  and to call me in again to your assistance  if you think you can be at all benefited by my help.\"  upon this simmias said  \"indeed  socrates  i will tell you the truth: for some time each of us  being in doubt  has been urging and exhorting the other to question you  from a desire to hear our doubts solved; but we were afraid of giving you trouble  lest it should be disagreeable to you in your present circumstances.\"  77. but he  upon hearing this  gently smiled  and said  \"bless me  simmias; with difficulty  indeed  could i persuade other men that i do not consider my present condition a calamity  since i am not able to persuade even you; but you are afraid lest i should be more morose now than during the former part of my life. and  as it seems  i appear to you to be inferior to swans with respect to divination  who  when they perceive that they must needs die  though they have been used to sing before  sing then more than ever  rejoicing that they are about to depart to that deity whose servants they are. but men  through their own fear of death  belie the swans too  and say that they  lamenting their death  sing their last song through grief; and they do not consider that no bird sings when it is hungry or cold  or is afflicted with any other pain  not even the nightingale  or swallow  or the hoopoes  which  they say  sing lamenting through grief. but neither do these birds appear to me to sing through sorrow  nor yet do swans; but  in my opinion  belonging to apollo  they are prophetic  and  foreseeing the blessings of hades  they sing and rejoice on that day more excellently than at any preceding time. 78. but i  too  consider myself to be a fellow-servant of the swans  and sacred to the same god; and that i have received the power of divination from our common master no less than they  and that i do not depart from this life with less spirits than they. on this account  therefore  it is right that you should both speak and ask whatever you please  so long as the athenian eleven permit.\"  \"you say well \" said simmias  \"and both i will tell you what are my doubts  and he  in turn  how far he does not assent to what has been said. for it appears to me  socrates  probably as it does to you with respect to these matters  that to know them clearly in the present life is either impossible or very difficult: on the other hand  however  not to test what has been said of them in every possible way  so as not to desist until  on examining them in every point of view  one has exhausted every effort  is the part of a very weak man. for we ought  with respect to these things  either to learn from others how they stand or to discover them for one s self; or  if both these are impossible  then  taking the best of human reasonings and that which is the most difficult to be confuted  and embarking on this  as one who risks himself on a raft  so to sail through life  unless one could be carried more safely  and with less risk  on a surer conveyance  or some divine reason. 79. i  therefore  shall not now be ashamed to question you  since you bid me do so  nor shall i blame myself hereafter for not having now told you what i think; for to me  socrates  when i consider the matter  both with myself and with cebes  what has been said does not appear to have been sufficiently proved.\"  then said socrates  \"perhaps  my friend  you have the truth on your side; but tell me in what respect it was not sufficiently proved.\"  \"in this \" he answered  \"because any one might use the same argument with respect to harmony  and a lyre  and its chords  that harmony is something invisible and incorporeal  very beautiful and divine  in a well-modulated lyre; but the lyre and its chords are bodies  and of corporeal form  compounded and earthly  and akin to that which is mortal. when any one  then  has either broken the lyre  or cut or burst the chords  he might maintain from the same reasoning as yours that it is necessary the harmony should still exist and not be destroyed; for there could be no possibility that the lyre should subsist any longer when the chords are burst; and that the chords  which are of a mortal nature  should subsist  but that the harmony  which is of the same nature and akin to that which is divine and immortal  should become extinct  and perish before that which is mortal; but he might say that the harmony must needs subsist somewhere  and that the wood and chords must decay before it can undergo any change. 80. for i think  socrates  that you yourself have arrived at this conclusion  that we consider the soul to be pretty much of this kind--namely  that our body being compacted and held together by heat and cold  dryness and moisture  and other such qualities  our soul is the fusion and harmony of these  when they are well and duly combined with each other. if  then  the soul is a kind of harmony  it is evident that when our bodies are unduly relaxed or strained  through diseases and other maladies  the soul must  of necessity  immediately perish  although it is most divine  just as other harmonies which subsist in sounds or in the various works of artisans; but that the remains of the body of each person last for a long time  till they are either burned or decayed. consider  then  what we shall say to this reasoning  if any one should maintain that the soul  being a fusion of the several qualities in the body  perishes first in that which is called death.\"  81. socrates  therefore  looking steadfastly at us  as he was generally accustomed to do  and smiling  said  \"simmias indeed speaks justly. if  then  any one of you is more prompt than i am  why does he not answer  for he seems to have handled my argument not badly? it appears to me  however  that before we make our reply we should first hear from cebes  what he  too  objects to our argument  in order that  some time intervening  we may consider what we shall say  and then when we have heard them  we may give up to them  if they appear to speak agreeably to truth; or  if not  we may then uphold our own argument. come  then  cebes \" he continued  \"say what it is that disturbs you  so as to cause your unbelief.\"  \"i will tell you \" said cebes; \"the argument seems to me to rest where it was  and to be liable to the same objection that we mentioned before. for  that our soul existed even before it came into this present form  i do not deny has been very elegantly  and  if it is not too much to say so  very fully  demonstrated; but that it still exists anywhere when we are dead does not appear to me to have been clearly proved; nor do i give in to the objection of simmias  that the soul is not stronger and more durable than the body  for it appears to me to excel very far all things of this kind. 82.  why  then   reason might say   do you still disbelieve? for  since you see that when a man dies his weaker part still exists  does it not appear to you to be necessary that the more durable part should still be preserved during this period?  consider  then  whether i say any thing to the purpose in reply to this. for i  too  as well as simmias  as it seems  stand in need of an illustration; for the argument appears to me to have been put thus  as if any one should advance this argument about an aged weaver who had died  that the man has not yet perished  but perhaps still exists somewhere; and  as a proof  should exhibit the garment which he wore and had woven himself  that it is entire and has not perished; and if any one should disbelieve him  he would ask  which of the two is the more durable  the species of a man or of a garment  that is constantly in use and being worn; then  should any one answer that the species of man is much more durable  he would think it demonstrated that  beyond all question  the man is preserved  since that which is less durable has not perished. 83. but i do not think  simmias  that this is the case  and do you consider what i say  for every one must think that he who argues thus argues  foolishly. for this weaver  having worn and woven many such garments  perished after almost all of them  but before the last  i suppose; and yet it does not on this account follow any the more that a man is inferior to or weaker than a garment. and i think  the soul might admit this same illustration with respect to the body  and he who should say the same things concerning them would appear to me to speak correctly  that the soul is more durable  but the body weaker and less durable; for he would say that each soul wears out many bodies  especially if it lives many years; for if the body wastes and is dissolved while the man still lives  but the soul continually weaves anew what is worn out  it must necessarily follow that when the soul is dissolved it must then have on its last garment  and perish before this alone; but when the soul has perished the body would show the weakness of its nature  and quickly rot and vanish. 84. so that it is not by any means right to place implicit reliance on this argument  and to believe that when we die our soul still exists somewhere. for  if any one should concede to him who admits even more than you do  and should grant to him that not only did our soul exist before we were born  but that even when we die nothing hinders the souls of some of us from still existing  and continuing to exist hereafter  and from being often born  and dying again--for so strong is it by nature  that it can hold out against repeated births--if he granted this  he would not yet concede that it does not exhaust itself in its many births  and at length perish altogether in some one of the deaths. but he would say that no one knows this death and dissolution of the body  which brings destruction to the soul; for it is impossible for any one of us to perceive it. if  however  this be the case  it follows that every one who is confident at the approach of death is foolishly confident  unless he is able to prove that the soul is absolutely immortal and imperishable; otherwise it necessarily follows that he who is about to die must be alarmed for his soul  lest in its present disunion from the body it should entirely perish.\"  85. upon this  all of us who had heard them speaking were disagreeably affected  as we afterward mentioned to each other; because  after we had been fully persuaded by the former arguments  they seemed to disturb us anew  and to cast us into a distrust  not only of the arguments already adduced  but of such as might afterward be urged  for fear lest we should not be fit judges of anything  or lest the things themselves should be incredible.   echec.  by the gods! phædo  i can readily excuse you; for  while i am now hearing you  it occurs to me to ask myself some such question as this: what arguments can we any longer believe? since the argument which socrates advanced  and which was exceedingly credible  has now fallen into discredit. for this argument  that our soul is a kind of harmony  produces a wonderful impression on me  both now and always  and in being mentioned  it has reminded me  as it were  that i  too  was formerly of the same opinion; so that i stand in need again  as if from the very beginning  of some other argument which may persuade me that the soul of one who dies does not die with the body. tell me  therefore  by jupiter! how socrates followed up the argument; and whether he  too  as you confess was the case with yourselves  seemed disconcerted at all  or not  but calmly maintained his position; and maintained it sufficiently or defectively. relate everything to me as accurately as you can.  86.  phæd.  indeed  echecrates  though i have often admired socrates  i was never more delighted than at being with him on that occasion. that he should be able to say something is perhaps not at all surprising; but i especially admired this in him--first of all  that he listened to the argument of the young men so sweetly  affably  and approvingly; in the next place  that he so quickly perceived how we were affected by their arguments; and  lastly  that he cured us so well and recalled us  when we were put to flight  as it were  and vanquished  and encouraged us to accompany him  and consider the argument with him.   echec.  how was that?   phæd.  i will tell you: i happened to be sitting at his right hand  near the bed  upon a low seat  but he himself sat much higher than i. stroking my head  then  and laying hold of the hair that hung on my neck--for he used  often  to play with my hairs--\"to-morrow \" he said  \"perhaps  phædo  you will cut off these beautiful locks?\"  \"it seems likely  socrates \" said i.  87. \"not if you are persuaded by me.\"  \"why so?\" i asked.  \"to-day \" he replied  \"both i ought to cut off mine and you yours  if our argument must die  and we are unable to revive it. and i  if i were you  and the arguments were to escape me  would take an oath  as the argives do  not to suffer my hair to grow until i had renewed the contest  and vanquished the arguments of simmias and cebes.\"  \"but \" i said  \"even hercules himself is said not to have been a match for two.\"  \"call upon me  then \" he said  \"as your iolaus  while it is yet day.\"  \"i do call on you  then \" i said  \"not as hercules upon iolaus  but as iolaus upon hercules.\"  \"it will make no difference \" he replied. \"but  first of all  we must beware lest we meet with some mischance.\"  \"what?\" i asked.  \"that we do not become \" he answered  \"haters of reasoning  as some become haters of men; for no greater evil can happen to any one than to hate reasoning. 88. but hatred of reasoning and hatred of mankind both spring from the same source. for hatred of mankind is produced in us from having placed too great reliance on some one without sufficient knowledge of him  and from having considered him to be a man altogether true  sincere  and faithful  and then  after a little while  finding him depraved and unfaithful  and after him another. and when a man has often experienced this  and especially from those whom he considered his most intimate and best friends  at length  having frequently stumbled  he hates all men  and thinks that there is no soundness at all in any of them. have you not perceived that this happens so?\"  \"certainly \" i replied.  \"is it not a shame?\" he said \"and is it not evident that such a one attempts to deal with men without sufficient knowledge of human affairs? for if he had dealt with them with competent knowledge  as the case really is  so he would have considered that the good and the bad are each very few in number  and that those between both are most numerous.\"  89. \"how say you?\" i asked.  \"in the same manner \" he replied  \"as with things very little and very large do you think that any thing is more rare than to find a very large on a very little man  or dog  or any thing else? and  again  swift or slow  beautiful or ugly  white or black? do you not perceive that of all such things the extremes are rare and few  but that the intermediate are abundant and numerous?\"  \"certainly \" i replied.  \"do you not think  then \" he continued  \"that if a contest in wickedness were proposed  even here very few would be found pre-eminent?\"  \"it is probable \" i said.  \"it is so \" he said  \"but in this respect reasonings do not resemble men  for i was just now following you as my leader  but in this they do resemble them  when any one believes in any argument as true without being skilled in the art of reasoning  and then shortly afterward it appears to him to be false  at one time being so and at another time not  and so on with one after another  and especially they who devote themselves to controversial arguments  you are aware  at length think they have become very wise and have alone discovered that there is nothing sound and stable either in things or reasonings but that all things that exist  as is the case with the euripus  are in a constant state of flux and reflux  and never continue in any one condition for any length of time.\"  \"you speak perfectly true \" i said.  90. \"would it not  then  phædo\" he said \"be a sad thing if  when there is a true and sound reasoning  and such as one can understand  one should then  through lighting upon such arguments as appear to be at one time true and at another false  not blame one s self and one s own want of skill  but at length  through grief  should anxiously transfer the blame from one s self to the arguments  and thereupon pass the rest of one s life in hating and reviling arguments and so be depraved of the truth and knowledge of things that exist?\"  \"by jupiter!\" i said  \"it would be sad  indeed.\"  \"in the first place  then \" he said  \"let us beware of this  and let us not admit into our souls the notion that there appears to be nothing sound in reasoning  but much rather that we are not yet in a sound condition  and that we ought vigorously and strenuously to endeavor to become sound  you and the others  on account of your whole future life  but i  on account of my death  since i am in danger  at the present time  of not behaving as becomes a philosopher with respect to this very subject  but as a wrangler  like those who are utterly uninformed 91. for they  when they dispute about any thing  care nothing at all for the subject about which the discussion is  but are anxious about this  that what they have themselves advanced shall appear true to the persons present. and i seem to myself on the present occasion to differ from them only in this respect  for i shall not be anxious to make what i say appear true to those who are present  except that may happen by the way  but that it may appear certainly to be so to myself. for i thus reason  my dear friend  and observe how interestedly. if what i say be true  it is well to be persuaded of it  but if nothing remains to one that is dead  i shall  at least  during the interval before death be less disagreeable to those present by my lamentations. but this ignorance of mine will not continue long  for that would be bad  but will shortly be put an end to. thus prepared  then  simmias and cebes \" he continued  \"i now proceed to my argument. do you  however  if you will be persuaded by me  pay little attention to socrates  but much more to the truth  and if i appear to you to say any thing true  assent to it  but if not  oppose me with all your might  taking good care that in my zeal i do not deceive both myself and you  and  like a bee  depart leaving my sting behind.\"  92. \"but let us proceed \" he said \"first of all  remind me of what you said  if i should appear to have forgotten it for simmias  as i think  is in doubt  and fears lest the soul  though more divine and beautiful than the body  should perish before it  as being a species of harmony. but cebes appeared to me to grant me this  that the soul is more durable than the body  but he argued that it is uncertain to every one  whether when the soul has worn out many bodies and that repeatedly  it does not  on leaving the last body  itself also perish  so that this very thing is death  the destruction of the soul  since the body never ceases decaying are not these the things  simmias and cebes  which we have to inquire into?\"  they both agreed that they were.  \"whether  then \" he continued \"do you reject all our former arguments  or some of them only  and not others?\"  \"some we do \" they replied  \"and others not.\"  \"what  then \" he proceeded  \"do you say about that argument in which we asserted that knowledge is reminiscence  and that  this being the case  our soul must necessarily have existed somewhere before it was inclosed in the body?\"  93. \"i  indeed \" replied cebes \"was both then wonderfully persuaded by it  and now persist in it  as in no other argument.\"  \"and i  too \" said simmias  \"am of the same mind  and should very much wonder if i should ever think otherwise on that point.\"  \"then \" socrates said  \"you must needs think otherwise  my theban friend  if this opinion holds good  that harmony is something compounded  and that the soul is a kind of harmony that results from the parts compacted together in the body. for surely you will not allow yourself to say that harmony was composed prior to the things from which it required to be composed would you allow this?\"  \"by no means  socrates\" he replied.  \"do you perceive  then \" he said  \"that this result from what you say  when you assert that the soul existed before it came into a human form and body  but that it was composed from things that did not yet exist? for harmony is not such as that to which you compare it  but first the lyre  and the chords  and the sounds yet unharmonized  exist  and  last of all  harmony is produced  and first perishes. how  then  will this argument accord with that?\"  \"not at all \" said simmias.  94. \"and yet \" he said  \"if in any argument  there ought to be an accordance in one respecting harmony.\"  \"there ought \" said simmias.  \"this of yours  however \" he said  \"is not in accordance. consider  then  which of these two statements do you prefer--that knowledge is reminiscence  or the soul harmony?\"  \"the former by far  socrates \" he replied; \"for the latter occurred to me without demonstration  through a certain probability and speciousness whence most men derive their opinions. but i am well aware that arguments which draw their demonstrations from probabilities are idle; and  unless one is on one s guard against them  they are very deceptive  both in geometry and all other subjects. but the argument respecting reminiscence and knowledge may be said to have been demonstrated by a satisfactory hypothesis. for in this way it was said that our soul existed before it came into the body  because the essence that bears the appellation of  that which is  belongs to it. but of this  as i persuade myself  i am fully and rightly convinced. it is therefore necessary  as it seems  that i should neither allow myself nor any one else to maintain that the soul is harmony.\"  95. \"but what  simmias \" said he  \"if you consider it thus? does it appear to you to appertain to harmony  or to any other composition  to subsist in any other way than the very things do of which it is composed?\"  \"by no means.\"  \"and indeed  as i think  neither to do any thing  nor suffer any thing else  besides what they do or suffer.\"  he agreed.  \"it does not  therefore  appertain to harmony to take the lead of the things of which it is composed  but to follow them.\"  he assented.  \"it is  then  far from being the case that harmony is moved or sends forth sounds contrariwise  or is in any other respect opposed to its parts?\"  \"far  indeed \" he said.  \"what  then? is not every harmony naturally harmony  so far as it has been made to accord?\"  \"i do not understand you \" he replied.  \"whether \" he said  \"if it should be in a greater degree and more fully made to accord  supposing that were possible  would the harmony be greater and more full; but if in a less degree and less fully  then would it be inferior and less full?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"is this  then  the case with the soul that  even in the smallest extent  one soul is more fully and in a greater degree  or less fully and in a less degree  this very thing  a soul  than another?\"  \"in no respect whatever \" he replied.  96. \"well  then \" he said  \"by jupiter! is one soul said to possess intelligence and virtue  and to be good  and another folly and vice  and to be bad? and is this said with truth?\"  \"with truth  certainly.\"  \"of those  then  who maintain that the soul is harmony  what will any one say that these things are in the soul  virtue and vice? will he call them another kind of harmony and discord  and say that the one  the good soul  is harmonized  and  being harmony  contains within itself another harmony  but that the other is discordant  and does not contain within itself another harmony?\"  \"i am unable to say \" replied simmias; \"but it is clear that he who maintains that opinion would say something of the kind.\"  \"but it has been already granted \" said he  \"that one soul is not more or less a soul than another; and this is an admission that one harmony is not to a greater degree or more fully  or to a less degree or less fully  a harmony  than another; is it not so?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"and that that which is neither more or less harmony is neither more nor less harmonized: is it so?\"  \"it is.\"  \"but does that which is neither more or less harmonized partake of more or less harmony  or an equal amount?\"  \"an equal amount.\"  97. \"a soul  therefore  since it is not more or less this very thing  a soul  than another  is not more or less harmonized?\"  \"even so.\"  \"such  then  being its condition  it can not partake of a greater degree of discord or harmony?\"  \"certainly not.\"  \"and  again  such being its condition  can one soul partake of a greater degree of vice or virtue than another  if vice be discord  and virtue harmony?\"  \"it can not.\"  \"or rather  surely  simmias  according to right reason  no soul will partake of vice  if it is harmony; for doubtless harmony  which is perfectly such  can never partake of discord?\"  \"certainly not.\"  \"neither  therefore  can a soul which is perfectly a soul partake of vice.\"  \"how can it  from what has been already said?\"  \"from this reasoning  then  all souls of all animals will be equally good  if  at least  they are by nature equally this very thing  souls?\"  \"it appears so to me  socrates \" he said.  \"and does it appear to you \" he said  \"to have been thus rightly argued  and that the argument would lead to this result  if the hypothesis were correct  that the soul is harmony?\"  98. \"on no account whatever \" he replied.  \"but what \" said he  \"of all the things that are in man? is there any thing else that you say bears rule except the soul  especially if it be wise?\"  \"i should say not.\"  \"whether by yielding to the passions in the body  or by opposing them? my meaning is this: for instance  when heat and thirst are present  by drawing it the contrary way  so as to hinder it from drinking; and when hunger is present  by hindering it from eating; and in ten thousand other instances we see the soul opposing the desires of the body. do we not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"but have we not before allowed that if the soul were harmony  it would never utter a sound contrary to the tension  relaxation  vibration  or any other affection to which its component parts are subject  but would follow  and never govern them?\"  \"we did allow it \" he replied  \"for how could we do otherwise?\"  \"what  then? does not the soul now appear to act quite the contrary  ruling over all the parts from which any one might say it subsists  and resisting almost all of them through the whole of life  and exercising dominion over them in all manner of ways; punishing some more severely even with pain  both by gymnastics and medicine  and others more mildly; partly threatening  and partly admonishing the desires  angers and fears  as if  being itself of a different nature  it were conversing with something quite different? 99. just as homer has done in the odyssey  where he speaks of ulysses-- having struck his breast  he chid his heart in the following words: bear up  my heart; ere this thou hast borne far worse.  do you think that he composed this in the belief that the soul was harmony  and capable of being led by the passions of the body  and not rather that it was able to lead and govern them  as being something much more divine than to be compared with harmony?\"  \"by jupiter! socrates  it appears so to me.\"  \"therefore  my excellent friend  it is on no account correct for us to say that the soul is a kind of harmony; for  as it appears  we should neither agree with homer  that divine poet  nor with ourselves.\"  \"such is the case \" he replied.  \"be it so  then \" said socrates  \"we have already  as it seems  sufficiently appeased this theban harmony. but how  cebes  and by what arguments  shall we appease this cadmus?\"  100. \"you appear to me \" replied cebes  \"to be likely to find out; for you have made out this argument against harmony wonderfully beyond my expectation. for when simmias was saying what his doubts were  i wondered very much whether any one would be able to answer his reasoning. it  therefore  appeared to me unaccountable that he did not withstand the very first onset of your argument. i should not  therefore  be surprised if the arguments of cadmus met with the same fate.\"  \"my good friend \" said socrates  \"do not speak so boastfully  lest some envious power should overthrow the argument that is about to be urged. these things  however  will be cared for by the deity; but let us  meeting hand to hand  in the manner of homer  try whether you say any thing to the purpose. this  then  is the sum of what you inquire you require it to be proved that our soul is imperishable and immortal; if a philosopher that is about to die  full of confidence and hope that after death he shall be far happier than if he had died after leading a different kind of life  shall not entertain this confidence foolishly and vainly. 101. but to show that the soul is something strong and divine  and that it existed before we men were born  you say not at all hinders  but that all these things may evince  not its immortality  but that the soul is durable  and existed an immense space of time before  and knew and did many things. but that  for all this  it was not at all the more immortal  but that its very entrance into the body of a man was the beginning of its destruction  as if it were a disease; so that it passes through this life in wretchedness  and at last perishes in that which is called death. but you say that it is of no consequence whether it comes into a body once or often  with respect to our occasion of fear; for it is right he should be afraid  unless he is foolish  who does not know  and can not give a reason to prove  that the soul is immortal. such  i think  cebes  is the sum of what you say; and i purposely repeat it often  that nothing may escape us  and  if you please  you may add to or take from it.\"  cebes replied  \"i do not wish at present either to take from or add to it; that is what i mean.\"  102. socrates  then having paused for some time  and considered something within himself  said  \"you inquire into no easy matter  cebes; for it is absolutely necessary to discuss the whole question of generation and corruption. if you please  then  i will relate to you what happened to me with reference to them; and afterward  if any thing that i shall say shall appear to you useful toward producing conviction on the subject you are now treating of  make use of it.\"  \"i do indeed wish it \" replied cebes.  \"hear my relation  then. when i was a young man  cebes  i was wonderfully desirous of that wisdom which they call a history of nature; for it appeared to me to be a very sublime thing to know the causes of every thing--why each thing is generated  why it perishes  and why it exists. and i often tossed myself upward and downward  considering first such things as these  whether when heat and cold have undergone a certain corruption  as some say  then animals are formed; and whether the blood is that by means of which we think  or air  or fire  or none of these  but that it is the brain that produces the perceptions of hearing  seeing  and smelling; and that from these come memory and opinion; and from memory and opinion  when in a state of rest  in the same way knowledge is produced. 103. and  again  considering the corruptions of these  and the affections incidental to the heavens and the earth  i at length appeared to myself so unskillful in these speculations that nothing could be more so. but i will give you a sufficient proof of this; for i then became  by these very speculations  so very blind with respect to things which i knew clearly before  as it appeared to myself and others  that i unlearned even the things which i thought i knew before  both on many other subjects and also this  why a man grows. for  before  i thought this was evident to every one--that it proceeds from eating and drinking; for that  when  from the food  flesh is added to flesh  bone to bone  and so on in the same proportion  what is proper to them is added to the several other parts  then the bulk which was small becomes afterward large  and thus that a little man becomes a big one. such was my opinion at that time. does it appear to you correct?\"  \"to me it does \" said cebes.  104. \"consider this further. i thought that i had formed a right opinion  when  on seeing a tall man standing by a short one  i judged that he was taller by the head  and in like manner  one horse than another; and  still more clearly than this  ten appeared to me to be more than eight by two being added to them  and that two cubits are greater than one cubit by exceeding it a half.\"  \"but now \" said cebes  \"what think you of these matters?\"  \"by jupiter!\" said he  \"i am far from thinking that i know the cause of these  for that i can not even persuade myself of this: when a person has added one to one  whether the one to which the addition has been made has become two  or whether that which has been added  and that to which the addition has been made  have become two by the addition of the one to the other. for i wonder if  when each of these was separate from the other  each was one  and they were not yet two; but when they have approached nearer each other this should be the cause of their becoming two--namely  the union by which they have been placed nearer one another. 105. nor yet  if any person should divide one  am i able to persuade myself that this  their division  is the cause of its becoming two. for this cause is the contrary to the former one of their becoming two; for then it was because they were brought nearer to each other  and the one was added to the other; but now it is because one is removed and separated from the other. nor do i yet persuade myself that i know why one is one  nor  in a word  why any thing else is produced  or perishes  or exists  according to this method of proceeding; but i mix up another method of my own at random  for this i can on no account give in to.\"  \"but  having once heard a person reading from a book  written  as he said  by anaxagoras  and which said that it is intelligence that sets in order and is the cause of all things  i was delighted with this cause  and it appeared to me in a manner to be well that intelligence should be the cause of all things  and i considered with myself  if this is so  that the regulating intelligence orders all things  and disposes each in such way as will be best for it. 106. if any one  then  should desire to discover the cause of every thing  in what way it is produced  or perishes  or exists  he must discover this respecting it--in what way it is best for it either to exist  or to suffer  or do any thing else. from this mode of reasoning  then  it is proper that a man should consider nothing else  both with respect to himself and others  than what is most excellent and best; and it necessarily follows that this same person must also know that which is worst  for that the knowledge of both of them is the same. thus reasoning with myself  i was delighted to think i had found in anaxagoras a preceptor who would instruct me in the causes of things  agreeably to my own mind  and that he would inform me  first  whether the earth is flat or round  and  when he had informed me  would  moreover  explain the cause and necessity of its being so  arguing on the principle of the better  and showing that it is better for it to be such as it is; and if he should say that it is in the middle  that he would  moreover  explain how it is better for it to be in the middle; and if he should make all this clear to me  i was prepared no longer to require any other species of cause. 107. i was in like manner prepared to inquire respecting the sun and moon and the other stars  with respect to their velocities in reference to each other  and their revolutions and other conditions  in what way it is better for both to act and be affected as it does and is. for i never thought that after he had said that these things were set in order by intelligence  he would introduce any other cause for them than that it is best for them to be as they are. hence  i thought  that in assigning the cause to each of them  and to all in common  he would explain that which is best for each  and the common good of all. and i would not have given up my hopes for a good deal; but  having taken up his books with great eagerness  i read through them as quickly as i could  that i might as soon as possible know the best and the worst.\"  108. \"from this wonderful hope  however  my friend  i was speedily thrown down  when  as i advance and read over his works  i meet with a man who makes no use of intelligence  nor assigns any causes for the ordering of all things  but makes the causes to consist of air  ether  and water  and many other things equally absurd. and he appeared to me to be very like one who should say that whatever socrates does he does by intelligence  and then  attempting to describe the causes of each particular action  should say  first of all  that for this reason i am now sitting here  because my body is composed of bones and sinews and that the bones are hard  and have joints separate from each other  but that the sinews  being capable of tension and contraction  cover the bones  together with the flesh and skin which contain them. the bones  therefore  being suspended in their sockets  the nerves  relaxing and tightening  enable me to bend my limbs as i now do  and from this cause i sit here bent up. 109. and if  again  he should assign other similar causes for my conversing with you  assigning as causes voice  and air  and hearing  and ten thousand other things of the kind  omitting to mention the real causes  that since it appeared better to the athenians to condemn me  i therefore thought it better to sit here  and more just to remain and submit to the punishment which they have ordered; for  by the dog! i think these sinews and bones would have been long ago either in megara or boeotia  borne thither by an opinion of that which is best  if i had not thought it more just and honorable to submit to whatever sentence the city might order than to flee and run stealthily away. but to call such things causes is too absurd. but if any one should say that without possessing such things as bones and sinews  and whatever else i have  i could not do what i pleased  he would speak the truth; but to say that i do as i do through them  and that i act thus by intelligence  and not from the choice of what is best  would be a great and extreme disregard of reason. 110. for this would be not to be able to distinguish that the real cause is one thing  and that another  without which a cause could not be a cause; which  indeed  the generality of men appear to me to do  fumbling  as it were  in the dark  and making use of strange names  so as to denominate them as the very cause. wherefore one encompassing the earth with a vortex from heaven makes the earth remain fixed; but another  as if it were a broad trough  rests it upon the air as its base; but the power by which these things are now so disposed that they may be placed in the best manner possible  this they neither inquire into  nor do they think that it requires any superhuman strength; but they think they will some time or other find out an atlas stronger and more immortal than this  and more capable of containing all things; and in reality  the good  and that which ought to hold them together and contain them  they take no account of at all. i  then  should most gladly have become the disciple of any one who would teach me of such a cause  in what way it is. but when i was disappointed of this  and was neither able to discover it myself  nor to learn it from another  do you wish  cebes  that i should show you in what way i set out upon a second voyage in search of the cause?\"  111. \"i wish it exceedingly \" he replied.  \"it appeared to me  then \" said he  \"after this  when i was wearied with considering things that exist  that i ought to beware lest i should suffer in the same way as they do who look at and examine an eclipse of the sun  for some lose the sight of their eyes  unless they behold its image in water  or some similar medium. and i was affected with a similar feeling  and was afraid lest i should be utterly blinded in my soul through beholding things with the eyes  and endeavoring to grasp them by means of the several senses. it seemed to me  therefore  that i ought to have recourse to reasons  and to consider in them the truth of things. perhaps  however  this similitude of mine may in some respect be incorrect; for i do not altogether admit that he who considers things in their reasons considers them in their images  more than he does who views them in their effects. however  i proceeded thus  and on each occasion laying down the reason  which i deem to be the strongest  whatever things appear to me to accord with this i regard as true  both with respect to the cause and every thing else; but such as do not accord i regard as not true. 112. but i wish to explain my meaning to you in a clearer manner; for i think that you do not yet understand me.\"  \"no  by jupiter!\" said cebes  \"not well.\"  \"however \" continued he  \"i am now saying nothing new  but what i have always at other times  and in a former part of this discussion  never ceased to say. i proceed  then  to attempt to explain to you that species of cause which i have busied myself about  and return again to those well-known subjects  and set out from them  laying down as an hypothesis  that there is a certain abstract beauty  and goodness  and magnitude  and so of all other things; which if you grant me  and allow that they do exist  i hope that i shall be able from these to explain the cause to you  and to discover that the soul is immortal.\"  \"but \" said cebes  \"since i grant you this  you may draw your conclusion at once.\"  \"but consider \" he said  \"what follows from thence  and see if you can agree with me. for it appears to me that if there is any thing else beautiful besides beauty itself  it is not beautiful for any other reason than because it partakes of that abstract beauty; and i say the same of every thing. do you admit such a cause?\"  \"i do admit it \" he replied.  113. \"i do not yet understand \" he continued  \"nor am i able to conceive  those other wise causes; but if any one should tell me why any thing is beautiful  either because it has a blooming florid color  or figure  or any thing else of the kind  i dismiss all other reasons  for i am confounded by them all; but i simply  wholly  and perhaps foolishly  confine myself to this  that nothing else causes it to be beautiful except either the presence or communication of that abstract beauty  by whatever means and in whatever way communicated; for i can not yet affirm this with certainty  but only that by means of beauty all beautiful things become beautiful. for this appears to me the safest answer to give both to myself and others; and adhering to this  i think that i shall never fall  but that it is a safe answer both for me and any one else to give--that by means of beauty beautiful things become beautiful. does it not also seem so to you?\"  \"it does.\"  \"and that by magnitude great things become great  and greater things  greater; and by littleness less things become less?\"  \"yes.\"  114. \"you would not  then  approve of it  if any one said that one person is greater than another by the head  and that the less is less by the very same thing; but you would maintain that you mean nothing else than that every thing that is greater than another is greater by nothing else than magnitude  and that it is greater on this account--that is  on account of magnitude; and that the less is less by nothing else than littleness  and on this account less--that is  on account of littleness; being afraid  i think  lest some opposite argument should meet you if you should say that any one is greater and less by the head; as  first  that the greater is greater  and the less less  by the very same thing; and  next  that the greater is greater by the head  which is small; and that it is monstrous to suppose that any one is great through something small. should you not be afraid of this?\"  to which said cebes  smilingly  \"indeed  i should.\"  \"should you not  then \" he continued  \"be afraid to say that ten is more than eight by two  and for this cause exceeds it  and not by number  and on account of number? and that two cubits are greater than one cubit by half  and not by magnitude (for the fear is surely the same)?\"  \"certainly \" he replied.  115. \"what  then? when one has been added to one  would you not beware of saying that the addition is the cause of its being two  or division when it has been divided; and would you not loudly assert that you know no other way in which each thing subsists  than by partaking of the peculiar essence of each of which it partakes  and that in these cases you can assign no other cause of its becoming two than its partaking of duality; and that such things as are to become two must needs partake of this  and what is to become one  of unity; but these divisions and additions  and other such subtleties  you would dismiss  leaving them to be given as answers by persons wiser than yourself; whereas you  fearing  as it is said  your own shadow and inexperience  would adhere to this safe hypothesis  and answer accordingly? but if any one should assail this hypothesis of yours  would you not dismiss him  and refrain from answering him till you had considered the consequences resulting from it  whether in your opinion they agree with or differ from each other? but when it should be necessary for you to give a reason for it  would you give one in a similar way  by again laying down another hypothesis  which should appear the best of higher principles  until you arrived at something satisfactory; but  at the same time  you would avoid making confusion  as disputants do  in treating of the first principle and the results arising from it  if you really desire to arrive at the truth of things? 116. for they  perhaps  make no account at all of this  nor pay any attention to it; for they are able  through their wisdom  to mingle all things together  and at the same time please themselves. but you  if you are a philosopher  would act  i think  as i now describe.\"  \"you speak most truly \" said simmias and cebes together.   echec.  by jupiter! phædo  they said so with good reason; for he appears to me to have explained these things with wonderful clearness  even to one endued with a small degree of intelligence.   phæd.  certainly  echecrates  and so it appeared to all who were present.   echec.  and so it appears to me  who was absent  and now hear it related. but what was said after this?  as well as i remember  when these things had been granted him  and it was allowed that each several idea exists of itself  and that other things partaking of them receive their denomination from them  he next asked: \"if  then \" he said  \"you admit that things are so  whether  when you say that simmias is greater than socrates  but less than phædo  do you not then say that magnitude and littleness are both in simmias?\"  \"i do.\"  117. \"and yet \" he said  \"you must confess that simmias s exceeding socrates is not actually true in the manner in which the words express it; for simmias does not naturally exceed socrates in that he is simmias  but in consequence of the magnitude which he happens to have; nor  again  does he exceed socrates because socrates is socrates  but because socrates possesses littleness in comparison with his magnitude?\"  \"true.\"  \"nor  again  is simmias exceeded by phædo  because phædo is phædo  but because phædo possesses magnitude in comparison with simmias s littleness?\"  \"it is so.\"  \"thus  then  simmias has the appellation of being both little and great  being between both  by exceeding the littleness of one through his own magnitude  and to the other yielding a magnitude that exceeds his own littleness.\" and at the same time  smiling  he said  \"i seem to speak with the precision of a short-hand writer; however  it is as i say.\"  he allowed it.  118. \"but i say it for this reason  wishing you to be of the same opinion as myself. for it appears to me  not only that magnitude itself is never disposed to be at the same time great and little  but that magnitude in us never admits the little nor is disposed to be exceeded  but one of two things  either to flee and withdraw when its contrary  the little  approaches it  or  when it has actually come  to perish; but that it is not disposed  by sustaining and receiving littleness  to be different from what it was. just as i  having received and sustained littleness  and still continuing the person that i am  am this same little person; but that  while it is great  never endures to be little. and  in like manner  the little that is in us is not disposed at any time to become or to be great  nor is any thing else among contraries  while it continues what it was  at the same time disposed to become and to be its contrary; but in this contingency it either departs or perishes.\"  119. \"it appears so to me \" said cebes  \"in every respect.\"  but some one of those present  on hearing this  i do not clearly remember who he was  said  \"by the gods! was not the very contrary of what is now asserted admitted in the former part of our discussion  that the greater is produced from the less  and the less from the greater  and  in a word  that the very production of contraries is from contraries? but now it appears to me to be asserted that this can never be the case.\"  upon this socrates  having leaned his head forward and listened  said  \"you have reminded me in a manly way; you do not  however  perceive the difference between what is now and what was then asserted. for then it was said that a contrary thing is produced from a contrary; but now  that a contrary can never become contrary to itself--neither that which is in us  nor that which is in nature. for then  my friend  we spoke of things that have contraries  calling them by the appellation of those things; but now we are speaking of those very things from the presence of which things so called receive their appellation  and of these very things we say that they are never disposed to admit of production from each other.\" 120. and  at the same time looking at cebes  \"has anything that has been said  cebes  disturbed you?\"  \"indeed \" said cebes  \"i am not at all so disposed; however  i by no means say that there are not many things that disturb me.\"  \"then \" he continued  \"we have quite agreed to this  that a contrary can never be contrary to itself.\"  \"most certainly \" he replied.  \"but  further \" he said  \"consider whether you will agree with me in this also. do you call heat and cold any thing?\"  \"i do.\"  \"the same as snow and fire?\"  \"by jupiter! i do not.\"  \"but heat is something different from fire  and cold something different from snow?\"  \"yes.\"  \"but this  i think  is apparent to you--that snow  while it is snow  can never  when it has admitted heat  as we said before  continue to be what it was  snow and hot; but  on the approach of heat  it must either withdraw or perish?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"and  again  that fire  when cold approaches it  must either depart or perish; but that it will never endure  when it has admitted coldness  to continue what it was  fire and cold?\"  121. \"you speak truly \" he said.  \"it happens  then \" he continued  \"with respect to some of such things  that not only is the idea itself always thought worthy of the same appellation  but likewise something else which is not  indeed  that idea itself  but constantly retains its form so long as it exists. what i mean will perhaps be clearer in the following examples: the odd in number must always possess the name by which we now call it  must it not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"must it alone  of all things--for this i ask--or is there any thing else which is not the same as the odd  but yet which we must always call odd  together with its own name  because it is so constituted by nature that it can never be without the odd? but this  i say  is the case with the number three  and many others. for consider with respect to the number three: does it not appear to you that it must always be called by its own name  as well as by that of the odd  which is not the same as the number three? yet such is the nature of the number three  five  and the entire half of number  that though they are not the same as the odd  yet each of them is always odd. and  again  two and four  and the whole other series of number  though not the same as the even  are nevertheless each of them always even: do you admit this  or not?\"  122. \"how should i not?\" he replied.  \"observe then \" said he  \"what i wish to prove. it is this--that it appears not only that these contraries do not admit each other  but that even such things as are not contrary to each other  and yet always possess contraries  do not appear to admit that idea which is contrary to the idea that exists in themselves  but  when it approaches  perish or depart. shall we not allow that the number three would first perish  and suffer any thing whatever  rather than endure  while it is still three  to become even?\"  \"most certainly \" said cebes.  \"and yet \" said he  \"the number two is not contrary to three.\"  \"surely not.\"  \"not only  then  do ideas that are contrary never allow the approach of each other  but some other things also do not allow the approach of contraries.\"  \"you say very truly \" he replied.  \"do you wish  then \" he said  \"that  if we are able  we should define what these things are?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"would they not then  cebes \" he said  \"be such things as  whatever they occupy  compel that thing not only to retain its own idea  but also that of something which is always a contrary?\"  \"how do you mean?\"  123. \"as we just now said. for you know  surely  that whatever things the idea of three occupies must of necessity not only be three  but also odd?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"to such a thing  then  we assert  that the idea contrary to that form which constitutes this can never come.\"  \"it can not.\"  \"but did the odd make it so?\"  \"yes.\"  \"and is the contrary to this the idea of the even?\"  \"yes.\"  \"the idea of the even  then  will never come to the three?\"  \"no  surely.\"  \"three  then  has no part in the even?\"  \"none whatever.\"  \"the number three is uneven?\"  \"yes.\"  \"what  therefore  i said should be defined--namely  what things they are which  though not contrary to some particular thing  yet do not admit of the contrary itself; as  in the present instance  the number three  though not contrary to the even  does not any the more admit it  for it always brings the contrary with it  just as the number two does to the odd  fire to cold  and many other particulars. consider  then  whether you would thus define  not only that a contrary does not admit a contrary  but also that that which brings with it a contrary to that to which it approaches will never admit the contrary of that which it brings with it. 124. but call it to mind again  for it will not be useless to hear it often repeated. five will not admit the idea of the even  nor ten  its double  that of the odd. this double  then  though it is itself contrary to something else  yet will not admit the idea of the odd  nor will half as much again  nor other things of the kind  such as the half and the third part  admit the idea of the whole  if you follow me  and agree with me that it is so.\"  \"i entirely agree with you \" he said  \"and follow you.\"  \"tell me again  then \" he said  \"from the beginning; and do not answer me in the terms in which i put the question  but in different ones  imitating my example. for i say this because  besides that safe mode of answering which i mentioned at first  from what has now been said  i see another no less safe one. for if you should ask me what that is which  if it be in the body  will cause it to be hot  i should not give you that safe but unlearned answer  that it is heat  but one more elegant  from what we have just now said  that it is fire; nor  if you should ask me what that is which  if it be in the body  will cause it to be diseased  should i say that it is disease  but fever; nor if you should ask what that is which  if it be in number  will cause it to be odd  should i say that it is unevenness  but unity; and so with other things. but consider whether you sufficiently understand what i mean.\"  125. \"perfectly so \" he replied.  \"answer me  then \" he said  \"what that is which  when it is in the body  the body will be alive?\"  \"soul \" he replied.  \"is not this  then  always the case?\"  \"how should it not be?\" said he.  \"does the soul  then  always bring life to whatever it occupies?\"  \"it does indeed \" he replied.  \"whether  then  is there any thing contrary to life or not?\"  \"there is \" he replied.  \"what?\"  \"death.\"  \"the soul  then  will never admit the contrary of that which it brings with it  as has been already allowed?\"  \"most assuredly \" replied cebes.  \"what  then? how do we denominate that which does not admit the idea of the even?\"  \"uneven \" he replied.  \"and that which does not admit the just  nor the musical?\"  \"unmusical \" he said  \"and unjust.\"  \"be it so. but what do we call that which does not admit death?\"  \"immortal \" he replied.  \"therefore  does not the soul admit death?\"  \"no.\"  \"is the soul  then  immortal?\"  \"immortal.\"  126. \"be it so \" he said. \"shall we say  then  that this has been now demonstrated? or how think you?\"  \"most completely  socrates.\"  \"what  then \" said he  \"cebes  if it were necessary for the uneven to be imperishable  would the number three be otherwise than imperishable?\"  \"how should it not?\"  \"if  therefore  it were also necessary that what is without heat should be imperishable  when any one should introduce heat to snow  would not the snow withdraw itself  safe and unmelted? for it would not perish; nor yet would it stay and admit the heat.\"  \"you say truly \" he replied.  \"in like manner  i think  if that which is insusceptible of cold were imperishable  that when any thing cold approached the fire  it would neither be extinguished nor perish  but would depart quite safe.\"  \"of necessity \" he said.  \"must we not  then  of necessity \" he continued  \"speak thus of that which is immortal? if that which is immortal is imperishable  it is impossible for the soul to perish  when death approaches it. for  from what has been said already  it will not admit death  nor will ever be dead; just as we said that three will never be even  nor  again  will the odd; nor will fire be cold  nor yet the heat that is in fire. 127. but some one may say  what hinders  though the odd can never become even by the approach of the even  as we have allowed  yet  when the odd is destroyed  that the even should succeed in its place? we could not contend with him who should make this objection that it is not destroyed  for the uneven is not imperishable; since  if this were granted us  we might easily have contended that  on the approach of the even  the odd and the three depart; and we might have contended in the same way with respect to fire  heat  and the rest  might we not?\"  \"certainly.\"  \"wherefore  with respect to the immortal  if we have allowed that it is imperishable  the soul  in addition to its being immortal  must also be imperishable; if not  there will be need of other arguments.\"  \"but there is no need \" he said  \"so far as that is concerned; for scarcely could any thing not admit of corruption  if that which is immortal and eternal is liable to it.\"  128. \"the deity  indeed  i think \" said socrates  \"and the idea itself of life  and if anything else is immortal  must be allowed by all beings to be incapable of dissolution.\"  \"by jupiter!\" he replied  \"by all men  indeed  and still more  as i think  by the gods.\"  \"since  then  that which is immortal is also incorruptible  can the soul  since it is immortal  be any thing else than imperishable?\"  \"it must  of necessity  be so.\"  \"when  therefore  death approaches a man  the mortal part of him  as it appears  dies  but the immortal part departs safe and uncorrupted  having withdrawn itself from death?\"  \"it appears so.\"  \"the soul  therefore \" he said  \"cebes  is most certainly immortal and imperishable  and our souls will really exist in hades.\"  \"therefore  socrates \" he said  \"i have nothing further to say against this  nor any reason for doubting your arguments. but if simmias here  or any one else  has any thing to say  it were well for him not to be silent; for i know not to what other opportunity beyond the present any one can defer it  who wishes either to speak or hear about these things.\"  \"but  indeed \" said simmias  \"neither have i any reason to doubt what has been urged; yet  from the magnitude of the subject discussed  and from my low opinion of human weakness  i am compelled still to retain a doubt within myself with respect to what has been said.\"  \"not only so  simmias \" said socrates  \"but you say this well; and  moreover  the first hypotheses  even though they are credible to you  should nevertheless be examined more carefully; and if you should investigate them sufficiently  i think you will follow my reasoning as far as it is possible for man to do so; and if this very point becomes clear  you will inquire no further.\"  \"you speak truly \" he said.  \"but it is right  my friends \" he said  \"that we should consider this--- that if the soul is immortal  it requires our care not only for the present time  which we call life  but for all time; and the danger would now appear to be dreadful if one should neglect it. 130. for if death were a deliverance from every thing  it would be a great gain for the wicked  when they die  to be delivered at the same time from the body  and from their vices together with the soul; but now  since it appears to be immortal  it can have no other refuge from evils  nor safety  except by becoming as good and wise as possible. for the soul goes to hades possessing nothing else than its discipline and education  which are said to be of the greatest advantage or detriment to the dead  on the very beginning of his journey thither. for  thus  it is said that each person s demon who was assigned to him while living  when he dies conducts him to some place  where they that are assembled together must receive sentence  and then proceed to hades with that guide who has been ordered to conduct them from hence thither. but there having received their deserts  and having remained the appointed time  another guide brings them back hither again  after many and long revolutions of time. the journey  then  is not such as the telephus of æschylus describes it; for he says that a simple path leads to hades; but it appears to me to be neither simple nor one  for there would be no need of guides  nor could any one ever miss the way  if there were but one. but now it appears to have many divisions and windings; and this i conjecture from our religious and funeral rites. 131. the well-ordered and wise soul  then  both follows  and is not ignorant of its present condition; but that which through passion clings to the body  as i said before  having longingly fluttered about it for a long time  and about its visible place  after vehement resistance and great suffering  is forcibly and with great difficulty led away by its appointed demon. and when it arrives at the place where the others are  impure and having done any such thing as the committal of unrighteous murders or other similar actions  which are kindred to these  and are the deeds of kindred souls  every one shuns it and turns away from it  and will be neither its fellow-traveler nor guide; but it wanders about  oppressed with every kind of helplessness  until certain periods have elapsed; and when these are completed  it is carried  of necessity  to an abode suitable to it. but the soul which has passed through life with purity and moderation  having obtained the gods for its fellow-travelers and guides  settles each in the place suited to it. 132. there are  indeed  many and wonderful places in the earth  and it is itself neither of such a kind nor of such a magnitude as is supposed by those who are accustomed to speak of the earth  as i have been persuaded by a certain person.\"  whereupon simmias said  \"how mean you  socrates? for i  too  have heard many things about the earth--not  however  those things which have obtained your belief. i would  therefore  gladly hear them.\"  \"indeed  simmias  the art of glaucus does not seem to me to be required to relate what these things are. that they are true  however  appears to me more than the art of glaucus can prove  and  besides  i should probably not be able to do it; and even if i did know how  what remains to me of life  simmias  seems insufficient for the length of the subject. however  the form of the earth  such as i am persuaded it is  and the different places in it  nothing hinders me from telling.\"  \"but that will be enough \" said simmias.  \"i am persuaded  then \" said he  \"in the first place  that  if the earth is in the middle of the heavens  and is of a spherical form  it has no need of air  nor of any other similar force  to prevent it from falling; but that the similarity of the heavens to themselves on every side  and the equilibrium of the earth itself  are sufficient to support it; for a thing in a state of equilibrium when placed in the middle of something that presses it equally on all sides can not incline more or less on any side  but  being equally affected all around  remains unmoved. 133. in the first place  then \" he said  \"i am persuaded of this.\"  \"and very properly so \" said simmias.  \"yet  further \" said he  \"that it is very large  and that we who inhabit some small portion of it  from the river phasis to the pillars of hercules  dwell about the sea  like ants or frogs about a marsh; and that many others elsewhere dwell in many similar places  for that there are everywhere about the earth many hollows of various forms and sizes into which there is a confluence of water  mist and air; but that the earth itself  being pure  is situated in the pure heavens  in which are the stars  and which most persons who are accustomed to speak about such things call ether; of which these things are the sediment  and are continually flowing into the hollow parts of the earth. 134. that we are ignorant  then  that we are dwelling in its hollows  and imagine that we inhabit the upper parts of the earth  just as if any one dwelling in the bottom of the sea should think that he dwelt on the sea  and  beholding the sun and the other stars through the water  should imagine that the sea was the heavens; but  through sloth and weakness  should never have reached the surface of the sea; nor  having emerged and risen up from the sea to this region  have seen how much more pure and more beautiful it is than the place where he is  nor has heard of it from any one else who has seen it. this  then  is the very condition in which we are; for  dwelling in some hollow of the earth  we think that we dwell on the surface of it  and call the air heaven  as if the stars moved through this  being heaven itself. but this is because  by reason of our weakness and sloth  we are unable to reach to the summit of the air. since  if any one could arrive at its summit  or  becoming winged  could fly up thither  or  emerging from hence  he would see--just as with us  fishes  emerging from the sea  behold what is here  so any one would behold the things there; and if his nature were able to endure the contemplation  he would know that that is the true heaven  and the true light  and the true earth. 135. for this earth and these stones  and the whole region here  are decayed and corroded  as things in the sea by the saltness; for nothing of any value grows in the sea  nor  in a word  does it contain any thing perfect; but there are caverns and sand  and mud in abundance  and filth  in whatever parts of the sea there is earth  nor are they at all worthy to be compared with the beautiful things with us. but  on the other hand  those things in the upper regions of the earth would appear far more to excel the things with us. for  if we may tell a beautiful fable  it is well worth hearing  simmias  what kind the things are on the earth beneath the heavens.\"  \"indeed  socrates \" said simmias  \"we should be very glad to hear that fable.\"  136. \"first of all  then  my friend \" he continued  \"this earth  if any one should survey it from above  is said to have the appearance of balls covered with twelve different pieces of leather  variegated and distinguished with colors  of which the colors found here  and which painters use  are  as it were  copies. but there the whole earth is composed of such  and far more brilliant and pure than these; for one part of it is purple  and of wonderful beauty  part of a golden color  and part of white  more white than chalk or snow  and  in like manner  composed of other colors  and those more in number and more beautiful than any we have ever beheld. and those very hollow parts of the earth  though filled with water and air  exhibit a certain species of color  shining among the variety of other colors  so that one continually variegated aspect presents itself to the view. in this earth  being such  all things that grow  grow in a manner proportioned to its nature--trees  flowers and fruits; and  again  in like manner  its mountains and stones possess  in the same proportion  smoothness and transparency  and more beautiful colors; of which the well-known stones here that are so highly prized are but fragments  such as sardine-stones  jaspers  and emeralds  and all of that kind. but there  there is nothing subsists that is not of this character  and even more beautiful than these. 137. but the reason of this is  because the stones there are pure  and not eaten up and decayed  like those here  by rottenness and saltness  which flow down hither together  and which produce deformity and disease in the stones and the earth  and in other things  even animals and plants. but that earth is adorned with all these  and  moreover  with gold and silver  and other things of the kind: for they are naturally conspicuous  being numerous and large  and in all parts of the earth; so that to behold it is a sight for the blessed. there are also many other animals and men upon it  some dwelling in mid-earth  others about the air  as we do about the sea  and others in islands which the air flows round  and which are near the continent; and  in one word  what water and the sea are to us  for our necessities  the air is to them; and what air is to us  that ether is to them. 138. but their seasons are of such a temperament that they are free from disease  and live for a much longer time than those here  and surpass us in sight  hearing  and smelling  and every thing of this kind  as much as air excels water  and ether air  in purity. moreover  they have abodes and temples of the gods  in which gods really dwell  and voices and oracles  and sensible visions of the gods  and such-like intercourse with them; the sun  too  and moon  and stars  are seen by them such as they really are  and their felicity in other respects is correspondent with these things.\"  \"and  such  indeed  is the nature of the whole earth  and the parts about the earth; but there are many places all round it throughout its cavities  some deeper and more open than that in which we dwell; but others that are deeper have a less chasm than our region  and others are shallower in depth than it is here  and broader. 139. but all these are in many places perforated one into another under the earth  some with narrower and some with wider channels  and have passages through  by which a great quantity of water flows from one into another  as into basins  and there are immense bulks of ever-flowing rivers under the earth  both of hot and cold water  and a great quantity of fire  and mighty rivers of fire  and many of liquid mire  some purer  and some more miry  as in sicily there are rivers of mud that flow before the lava  and the lava itself  and from these the several places are filled  according as the overflow from time to time happens to come to each of them. but all these move up and down  as it were  by a certain oscillation existing in the earth. and this oscillation proceeds from such natural cause as this; one of the chasms of the earth is exceedingly large  and perforated through the entire earth  and is that which homer speaks of   very far off  where is the most profound abyss beneath the earth   which elsewhere both he and many other poets have called tartarus. for into this chasm all rivers flow together  and from it flow out again; but they severally derive their character from the earth through which they flow. 140. and the reason why all streams flow out from thence  and flow into it  is because this liquid has neither bottom nor base. therefore  it oscillates and fluctuates up and down  and the air and the wind around it do the same; for they accompany it both when it rushes to those parts of the earth  and when to these. and as in respiration the flowing breath is continually breathed out and drawn in  so there the wind oscillating with the liquid causes certain vehement and irresistible winds both as it enters and goes out. when  therefore  the water rushing in descends to the place which we call the lower region  it flows through the earth into the streams there  and fills them  just as men pump up water. but when again it leaves those regions and rushes hither  it again fills the rivers here; and these  when filled  flow through channels and through the earth  and  having severally reached the several places to which they are journeying  they make seas  lakes  rivers  and fountains. 141. then  sinking again from thence beneath the earth  some of them having gone round longer and more numerous places  and others round fewer and shorter  they again discharge themselves into tartarus--some much lower than they were drawn up  others only a little so; but all of them flow in again beneath the point at which they flowed out. and some issue out directly opposite the place by which they flow in  others on the same side. there are also some which  having gone round altogether in a circle  folding themselves once or several times round the earth  like serpents  when they have descended as low as possible  discharge themselves again; and it is possible for them to descend on either side as far as the middle  but not beyond; for in each direction there is an acclivity to the streams both ways.\"  \"now  there are many other large and various streams; but among this great number there are four certain streams  of which the largest  and that which flows most outwardly round the earth  is called ocean; but directly opposite this  and flowing in a contrary direction  is acheron  which flows through other desert places  and  moreover  passing under the earth  reaches the acherusian lake  where the souls of most who die arrive; and  having remained there for certain destined periods  some longer and some shorter  are again sent forth into the generations of animals. 142. a third river issues midway between these  and  near its source  falls into a vast region  burning with abundance of fire  and forms a lake larger than our sea  boiling with water and mud. from hence it proceeds in a circle  turbulent and muddy  and  folding itself round it  reaches both other places and the extremity of the acherusian lake  but does not mingle with its water; but  folding itself oftentimes beneath the earth  it discharges itself into the lower parts of tartarus. and this is the river which they call pyriphlegethon  whose burning streams emit dissevered fragments in whatever part of the earth they happen to be. opposite to this  again  the fourth river first falls into a place dreadful and savage  as it is said  having its whole color like cyanus: this they call stygian  and the lake which the river forms by its discharge  styx. this river  having fallen in here  and received awful power in the water  sinking beneath the earth  proceeds  folding itself round  in an opposite course to pyriphlegethon  and meets it in the acherusian lake from  a contrary direction. neither does the water of this river mingle with any other; but it  too  having gone round in a circle  discharges itself into tartarus  opposite to pyriphlegethon. its name  as the poets say  is cocytus.\"  143. \"these things being thus constituted  when the dead arrive at the place to which their demon leads them severally  first of all they are judged  as well those who have lived well and piously  as those who have not. and those who appear to have passed a middle kind of life  proceeding to acheron  and embarking in the vessels they have  on these arrive at the lake  and there dwell; and when they are purified  and have suffered punishment for the iniquities they may have committed  they are set free  and each receives the reward of his good deeds  according to his deserts. but those who appear to be incurable  through the magnitude of their offenses  either from having committed many and great sacrileges  or many unjust and lawless murders  or other similar crimes  these a suitable destiny hurls into tartarus  whence they never come forth. 144. but those who appear to have been guilty of curable yet great offenses--such as those who  through anger  have committed any violence against father or mother  and have lived the remainder of their life in a state of penitence  or they who have become homicides in a similar manner--these must  of necessity  fall into tartarus. but after they have fallen  and have been there for a year  the wave casts them forth  the homicides into cocytus  but the parricides and matricides into pyriphlegethon. but when  being borne along  they arrive at the acherusian lake  there they cry out to and invoke  some those whom they slew  others those whom they injured  and  invoking them  they entreat and implore them to suffer them to go out into the lake  and to receive them  and if they persuade them  they go out  and are freed from their sufferings  but if not  they are borne back to tartarus  and thence again to the rivers. and they do not cease from suffering this until they have persuaded those whom they have injured  for this sentence was imposed on them by the judges. 145. but those who are found to have lived an eminently holy life  these are they who  being freed and set at large from these regions in the earth as from a prison  arrive at the pure abode above  and dwell on the upper parts of the earth. and among these  they who have sufficiently purified themselves by philosophy shall live without bodies  throughout all future time  and shall arrive at habitations yet more beautiful than these which it is neither easy to describe  nor at present is there sufficient time for the purpose.\"  \"but  for the sake of these things which we have described  we should use every endeavor  simmias  so as to acquire virtue and wisdom in this life  for the reward is noble  and the hope great.\"  \"to affirm positively  indeed  that these things are exactly as i have described them does not become a man of sense. that  however  either this  or something of the kind  takes place with respect to our souls and their habitations--since our soul is certainly immortal--this appears to me most fitting to be believed  and worthy the hazard for one who trusts in its reality; for the hazard is noble  and it is right to allure ourselves with such things  as with enchantments  for which reason i have prolonged my story to such a length. 146. on account of these things  then  a man ought to be confident about his soul who  during this life  has disregarded all the pleasures and ornaments of the body as foreign from his nature  and who  having thought that they do more harm than good  has zealously applied himself to the acquirement of knowledge  and who  having adorned his soul  not with a foreign  but its own proper ornament--temperance  justice  fortitude  freedom  and truth--thus waits for his passage to hades  as one who is ready to depart whenever destiny shall summon him. you  then \" he continued  \"simmias and cebes  and the rest  will each of you depart at some future time  but now destiny summons me  as a tragic writer would say  and it is nearly time for me to betake myself to the bath  for it appears to me to be better to drink the poison after i have bathed myself  and not to trouble the women with washing my dead body.\"  147. when he had thus spoken  crito said  \"so be it  socrates  but what commands have you to give to these or to me  either respecting your children  or any other matter  in attending to which we can most oblige you?\"  \"what i always say  crito \" he replied  \"nothing new that by taking care of yourselves you will oblige both me and mine  and yourselves  whatever you do  though you should not now promise it  and if you neglect yourselves  and will not live  as it were  in the footsteps of what has been now and formerly said  even though you should promise much at present  and that earnestly  you will do no good at all.\"  \"we will endeavor  then  so to do \" he said. \"but how shall we bury you?\"  \"just as you please \" he said  \"if only you can catch me  and i do not escape from you.\" 148. and  at the same time smiling gently  and looking round on us  he said  \"i cannot persuade crito  my friends  that i am that socrates who is now conversing with you  and who methodizes each part of the discourse; but he thinks that i am he whom he will shortly behold dead  and asks how he should bury me. but that which i some time since argued at length  that when i have drunk the poison i shall no longer remain with you  but shall depart to some happy state of the blessed  this i seem to have urged to him in vain  though i meant at the same time to console both you and myself. be ye  then  my sureties to crito \" he said  \"in an obligation contrary to that which he made to the judges (for he undertook that i should remain); but do you be sureties that  when i die  i shall not remain  but shall depart  that crito may more easily bear it; and  when he sees my body either burned or buried  may not be afflicted for me  as if i suffered from some dreadful thing; nor say at my interment that socrates is laid out  or is carried out  or is buried. 149. for be well assured \" he said  \"most excellent crito  that to speak improperly is not only culpable as to the thing itself  but likewise occasions some injury to our souls. you must have a good courage  then  and say that you bury my body  and bury it in such a manner as is pleasing to you  and as you think is most agreeable to our laws.\"  when he had said thus  he rose  and went into a chamber to bathe  and crito followed him  but he directed us to wait for him. we waited  therefore  conversing among ourselves about what had been said  and considering it again  and sometimes speaking about our calamity  how severe it would be to us  sincerely thinking that  like those who are deprived of a father  we should pass the rest of our life as orphans. when he had bathed  and his children were brought to him (for he had two little sons and one grown up)  and the women belonging to his family were come  having conversed with them in the presence of crito  and given them such injunctions as he wished  he directed the women and children to go away  and then returned to us. and it was now near sunset; for he spent a considerable time within. 150. but when he came from bathing he sat down  and did not speak much afterward; then the officer of the eleven came in  and  standing near him  said  \"socrates  i shall not have to find that fault with you that i do with others  that they are angry with me  and curse me  when  by order of the archons  i bid them drink the poison. but you  on all other occasions during the time you have been here  i have found to be the most noble  meek  and excellent man of all that ever came into this place; and  therefore  i am now well convinced that you will not be angry with me (for you know who are to blame)  but with them. now  then (for you know what i came to announce to you)  farewell  and endeavor to bear what is inevitable as easily as possible.\" and at the same time  bursting into tears  he turned away and withdrew.  151. and socrates  looking after him  said  \"and thou  too  farewell. we will do as you direct.\" at the same time turning to us  he said  \"how courteous the man is! during the whole time i have been here he has visited me  and conversed with me sometimes  and proved the worthiest of men; and now how generously he weeps for me! but come  crito  let us obey him  and let some one bring the poison  if it is ready pounded; but if not  let the man pound it.\"  then crito said  \"but i think  socrates  that the sun is still on the mountains  and has not yet set. besides  i know that others have drunk the poison very late  after it had been announced to them  and have supped and drunk freely  and some even have enjoyed the objects of their love. do not hasten  then  for there is yet time.\"  upon this socrates replied  \"these men whom you mention  crito  do these things with good reason  for they think they shall gain by so doing; and i  too  with good reason  shall not do so; for i think i shall gain nothing by drinking a little later  except to become ridiculous to myself  in being so fond of life  and sparing of it  when none any longer remains. go then \" he said  \"obey  and do not resist.\"  152. crito  having heard this  nodded to the boy that stood near. and the boy  having gone out and staid for some time  came  bringing with him the man that was to administer the poison  who brought it ready pounded in a cup. and socrates  on seeing the man  said  \"well  my good friend  as you are skilled in these matters  what must i do?\"  \"nothing else \" he replied  \"than  when you have drunk it  walk about until there is a heaviness in your legs; then lie down: thus it will do its purpose.\" and at the same time he held out the cup to socrates. and he having received it very cheerfully  echecrates neither trembling  nor changing at all in color or countenance  but  as he was wont  looking steadfastly at the man  said  \"what say you of this potion  with respect to making a libation to any one  is it lawful or not?\"  \"we only pound so much  socrates \" he said  \"as we think sufficient to drink.\"  153. \"i understand you \" he said; \"but it is certainly both lawful and right to pray to the gods  that my departure hence thither may be happy; which  therefore  i pray  and so may it be.\" and as he said this  he drank it off readily and calmly. thus far  most of us were with difficulty able to restrain ourselves from weeping; but when we saw him drinking  and having finished the draught  we could do so no longer; but  in spite of myself  the tears came in full torrent  so that  covering my face  i wept for myself; for i did not weep for him  but for my own fortune  in being deprived of such a friend. but crito  even before me  when he could not restrain his tears  had risen up. 154. but apollodorus  even before this  had not ceased weeping; and then  bursting into an agony of grief  weeping and lamenting  he pierced the heart of every one present  except socrates himself. but he said  \"what are you doing  my admirable friends? i  indeed  for this reason chiefly  sent away the women  that they might not commit any folly of this kind. for i have heard that it is right to die with good omens. be quiet  therefore  and bear up.\"  when we heard this  we were ashamed  and restrained our tears. but he  having walked about  when he said that his legs were growing heavy  lay down on his back; for the man had so directed him. and  at the same time  he who gave the poison taking hold of him  after a short interval  examined his feet and legs; and then  having pressed his foot hard  he asked if he felt it: he said that he did not. and after this he pressed his thighs; and  thus going higher  he showed us that he was growing cold and stiff. then socrates touched himself  and said that when the poison reached his heart he should then depart. 155. but now the parts around the lower belly were almost cold; when  uncovering himself  for he had been covered over  he said (and they were his last words)  \"crito  we owe a cock to aesculapius; pay it  therefore; and do not neglect it.\"  \"it shall be done \" said crito; \"but consider whether you have any thing else to say.\"  to this question he gave no reply; but  shortly after  he gave a convulsive movement  and the man covered him  and his eyes were fixed; and crito  perceiving it  closed his mouth and eyes.  this  echecrates  was the end of our friend --a man  as we may say  the best of all of his time that we have known  and  moreover  the most wise and just.
