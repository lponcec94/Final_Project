       "'perpetual peace a philosophical essay  by immanuel kant  1795  translation “perpetual peace”  we need not try to decide whether this satirical inscription  (once found on a dutch innkeeper’s sign-board above the picture of a churchyard) is aimed at mankind in general  or at the rulers of states in particular  unwearying in their love of war  or perhaps only at the philosophers who cherish the sweet dream of perpetual peace. the author of the present sketch would make one stipulation  however. the practical politician stands upon a definite footing with the theorist: with great self-complacency he looks down upon him as a mere pedant whose empty ideas can threaten no danger to the state (starting as it does from principles derived from experience)  and who may always be permitted to knock down his eleven skittles at once without a worldly-wise statesman needing to disturb himself. hence  in the event of a quarrel arising between the two  the practical statesman must always act consistently  and not scent danger to the state behind opinions ventured by the theoretical politician at random and publicly expressed. with which saving clause (clausula salvatoria) the author will herewith consider himself duly and expressly protected against all malicious misinterpretation. first section  containing the preliminary articles of perpetual peace between states  1. “no treaty of peace shall be regarded as valid  if made with the secret reservation of material for a future war.”  for then it would be a mere truce  a mere suspension of hostilities  not peace. a peace signifies the end of all hostilities and to attach to it the epithet “eternal” is not only a verbal pleonasm  but matter of suspicion. the causes of a future war existing  although perhaps not yet known to the high contracting parties themselves  are entirely annihilated by the conclusion of peace  however acutely they may be ferreted out of documents in the public archives. there may be a mental reservation of old claims to be thought out at a future time  which are  none of them  mentioned at this stage  because both parties are too much exhausted to continue the war  while the evil intention remains of using the first favourable opportunity for further hostilities. diplomacy of this kind only jesuitical casuistry can justify: it is beneath the dignity of a ruler  just as acquiescence in such processes of reasoning is beneath the dignity of his minister  if one judges the facts as they really are.  if  however  according to present enlightened ideas of political wisdom  the true glory of a state lies in the uninterrupted development of its power by every possible means  this judgment must certainly strike one as scholastic and pedantic.  2. “no state having an independent existence whether it be great or small shall be acquired by another through inheritance  exchange  purchase or donation.”    for a state is not a property (patrimonium)  as may be the ground on which its people are settled. it is a society of human beings over whom no one but itself has the right to rule and to dispose. like the trunk of a tree  it has its own roots  and to graft it on to another state is to do away with its existence as a moral person  and to make of it a thing. hence it is in contradiction to the idea of the original contract without which no right over a people is thinkable. everyone knows to what danger the bias in favour of these modes of acquisition has brought europe (in other parts of the world it has never been known). the custom of marriage between states  as if they were individuals  has survived even up to the most recent times  and is regarded partly as a new kind of industry by which ascendency may be acquired through family alliances  without any expenditure of strength; partly as a device for territorial expansion. moreover  the hiring out of the troops of one state to another to fight against an enemy not at war with their native country is to be reckoned in this connection; for the subjects are in this way used and abused at will as personal property.  3. “standing armies (miles perpetuus) shall be abolished in course of time.”  for they are always threatening other states with war by appearing to be in constant readiness to fight. they incite the various states to outrival one another in the number of their soldiers  and to this number no limit can be set. now  since owing to the sums devoted to this purpose  peace at last becomes even more oppressive than a short war  these standing armies are themselves the cause of wars of aggression  undertaken in order to get rid of this burden. to which we must add that the practice of hiring men to kill or to be killed seems to imply a use of them as mere machines and instruments in the hand of another (namely  the state) which cannot easily be reconciled with the right of humanity in our own person. the matter stands quite differently in the case of voluntary periodical military exercise on the part of citizens of the state  who thereby seek to secure themselves and their country against attack from without.  the accumulation of treasure in a state would in the same way be regarded by other states as a menace of war  and might compel them to anticipate this by striking the first blow. for of the three forces  the power of arms  the power of alliance and the power of money  the last might well become the most reliable instrument of war  did not the difficulty of ascertaining the amount stand in the way.  4. “no national debts shall be contracted in connection with the external affairs of the state.”  this source of help is above suspicion  where assistance is sought outside or within the state  on behalf of the economic administration of the country (for instance  the improvement of the roads  the settlement and support of new colonies  the establishment of granaries to provide against seasons of scarcity  and so on). but  as a common weapon used by the powers against one another  a credit system under which debts go on indefinitely increasing and are yet always assured against immediate claims (because all the creditors do not put in their claim at once) is a dangerous money power. this ingenious invention of a commercial people in the present century is  in other words  a treasure for the carrying on of war which may exceed the treasures of all the other states taken together  and can only be exhausted by a threatening deficiency in the taxes an event  however  which will long be kept off by the very briskness of commerce resulting from the reaction of this system on industry and trade. the ease  then  with which war may be waged  coupled with the inclination of rulers towards it an inclination which seems to be implanted in human nature is a great obstacle in the way of perpetual peace. the prohibition of this system must be laid down as a preliminary article of perpetual peace  all the more necessarily because the final inevitable bankruptcy of the state in question must involve in the loss many who are innocent; and this would be a public injury to these states. therefore other nations are at least justified in uniting themselves against such an one and its pretensions.  5. “no state shall violently interfere with the constitution and administration of another.”  for what can justify it in so doing? the scandal which is here presented to the subjects of another state? the erring state can much more serve as a warning by exemplifying the great evils which a nation draws down on itself through its own lawlessness. moreover  the bad example which one free person gives another  (as scandalum acceptum) does no injury to the latter. in this connection  it is true  we cannot count the case of a state which has become split up through internal corruption into two parts  each of them representing by itself an individual state which lays claim to the whole. here the yielding of assistance to one faction could not be reckoned as interference on the part of a foreign state with the constitution of another  for here anarchy prevails. so long  however  as the inner strife has not yet reached this stage the interference of other powers would be a violation of the rights of an independent nation which is only struggling with internal disease. it would therefore itself cause a scandal  and make the autonomy of all states insecure.  6. “no state at war with another shall countenance such modes of hostility as would make mutual confidence impossible in a subsequent state of peace: such are the employment of assassins (percussores) or of poisoners (venefici)  breaches of capitulation  the instigating and making use of treachery (perduellio) in the hostile state.”  these are dishonourable stratagems. for some kind of confidence in the disposition of the enemy must exist even in the midst of war  as otherwise peace could not be concluded  and the hostilities would pass into a war of extermination (bellum internecinum). war  however  is only our wretched expedient of asserting a right by force  an expedient adopted in the state of nature  where no court of justice exists which could settle the matter in dispute. in circumstances like these  neither of the two parties can be called an unjust enemy  because this form of speech presupposes a legal decision: the issue of the conflict just as in the case of the so-called judgments of god decides on which side right is. between states  however  no punitive war (bellum punitivum) is thinkable  because between them a relation of superior and inferior does not exist. whence it follows that a war of extermination  where the process of annihilation would strike both parties at once and all right as well  would bring about perpetual peace only in the great graveyard of the human race. such a war then  and therefore also the use of all means which lead to it  must be absolutely forbidden. that the methods just mentioned do inevitably lead to this result is obvious from the fact that these infernal arts  already vile in themselves  on coming into use  are not long confined to the sphere of war. take  for example  the use of spies (uti exploratoribus). here only the dishonesty of others is made use of; but vices such as these  when once encouraged  cannot in the nature of things be stamped out and would be carried over into the state of peace  where their presence would be utterly destructive to the purpose of that state.  although the laws stated are  objectively regarded  (i.e. in so far as they affect the action of rulers) purely prohibitive laws (leges prohibitivæ)  some of them (leges strictæ) are strictly valid without regard to circumstances and urgently require to be enforced. such are nos. 1  5  6. others  again  (like nos. 2  3  4) although not indeed exceptions to the maxims of law  yet in respect of the practical application of these maxims allow subjectively of a certain latitude to suit particular circumstances. the enforcement of these leges latæ may be legitimately put off  so long as we do not lose sight of the ends at which they aim. this purpose of reform does not permit of the deferment of an act of restitution (as  for example  the restoration to certain states of freedom of which they have been deprived in the manner described in article 2) to an infinitely distant date as augustus used to say  to the “greek kalends”  a day that will never come. this would be to sanction non-restitution. delay is permitted only with the intention that restitution should not be made too precipitately and so defeat the purpose we have in view. for the prohibition refers here only to the mode of acquisition which is to be no longer valid  and not to the fact of possession which  although indeed it has not the necessary title of right  yet at the time of so-called acquisition was held legal by all states  in accordance with the public opinion of the time. second section  containing the definitive articles of a perpetual peace between states  a state of peace among men who live side by side is not the natural state (status naturalis)  which is rather to be described as a state of war: that is to say  although there is not perhaps always actual open hostility  yet there is a constant threatening that an outbreak may occur. thus the state of peace must be established. for the mere cessation of hostilities is no guarantee of continued peaceful relations  and unless this guarantee is given by every individual to his neighbour which can only be done in a state of society regulated by law one man is at liberty to challenge another and treat him as an enemy.  first definitive article of perpetual peace  i. “the civil constitution of each state shall be republican.”  the only constitution which has its origin in the idea of the original contract  upon which the lawful legislation of every nation must be based  is the republican. it is a constitution  in the first place  founded in accordance with the principle of the freedom of the members of society as human beings: secondly  in accordance with the principle of the dependence of all  as subjects  on a common legislation: and  thirdly  in accordance with the law of the equality of the members as citizens. it is then  looking at the question of right  the only constitution whose fundamental principles lie at the basis of every form of civil constitution. and the only question for us now is  whether it is also the one constitution which can lead to perpetual peace.  now the republican constitution apart from the soundness of its origin  since it arose from the pure source of the concept of right  has also the prospect of attaining the desired result  namely  perpetual peace. and the reason is this. if  as must be so under this constitution  the consent of the subjects is required to determine whether there shall be war or not  nothing is more natural than that they should weigh the matter well  before undertaking such a bad business. for in decreeing war  they would of necessity be resolving to bring down the miseries of war upon their country. this implies: they must fight themselves; they must hand over the costs of the war out of their own property; they must do their poor best to make good the devastation which it leaves behind; and finally  as a crowning ill  they have to accept a burden of debt which will embitter even peace itself  and which they can never pay off on account of the new wars which are always impending. on the other hand  in a government where the subject is not a citizen holding a vote  (i.e. in a constitution which is not republican)  the plunging into war is the least serious thing in the world. for the ruler is not a citizen  but the owner of the state  and does not lose a whit by the war  while he goes on enjoying the delights of his table or sport  or of his pleasure palaces and gala days. he can therefore decide on war for the most trifling reasons  as if it were a kind of pleasure party. any justification of it that is necessary for the sake of decency he can leave without concern to the diplomatic corps who are always only too ready with their services.             the following remarks must be made in order that we may not fall into the common error of confusing the republican with the democratic constitution. the forms of the state (civitas) may be classified according to either of two principles of division: the difference of the persons who hold the supreme authority in the state  and the manner in which the people are governed by their ruler whoever he may be. the first is properly called the form of sovereignty (forma imperii)  and there can be only three constitutions differing in this respect: where  namely  the supreme authority belongs to only one  to several individuals working together  or to the whole people constituting the civil society. thus we have autocracy or the sovereignty of a monarch  aristocracy or the sovereignty of the nobility  and democracy or the sovereignty of the people. the second principle of division is the form of government (forma regiminis)  and refers to the way in which the state makes use of its supreme power: for the manner of government is based on the constitution  itself the act of that universal will which transforms a multitude into a nation. in this respect the form of government is either republican or despotic. republicanism is the political principle of severing the executive power of the government from the legislature. despotism is that principle in pursuance of which the state arbitrarily puts into effect laws which it has itself made: consequently it is the administration of the public will  but this is identical with the private will of the ruler. of these three forms of a state  democracy  in the proper sense of the word  is of necessity despotism  because it establishes an executive power  since all decree regarding and  if need be  against any individual who dissents from them. therefore the “whole people”  so-called  who carry their measure are really not all  but only a majority: so that here the universal will is in contradiction with itself and with the principle of freedom.  every form of government in fact which is not representative is really no true constitution at all  because a law-giver may no more be  in one and the same person  the administrator of his own will  than the universal major premise of a syllogism may be  at the same time  the subsumption under itself of the particulars contained in the minor premise. and  although the other two constitutions  autocracy and aristocracy  are always defective in so far as they leave the way open for such a form of government  yet there is at least always a possibility in these cases  that they may take the form of a government in accordance with the spirit of a representative system. thus frederick the great used at least to say that he was “merely the highest servant of the state.” the democratic constitution  on the other hand  makes this impossible  because under such a government every one wishes to be master. we may therefore say that the smaller the staff of the executive that is to say  the number of rulers and the more real  on the other hand  their representation of the people  so much the more is the government of the state in accordance with a possible republicanism; and it may hope by gradual reforms to raise itself to that standard. for this reason  it is more difficult under an aristocracy than under a monarchy while under a democracy it is impossible except by a violent revolution to attain to this  the one perfectly lawful constitution. the kind of government  however  is of infinitely more importance to the people than the kind of constitution  although the greater or less aptitude of a people for this ideal greatly depends upon such external form. the form of government  however  if it is to be in accordance with the idea of right  must embody the representative system in which alone a republican form of administration is possible and without which it is despotic and violent  be the constitution what it may. none of the ancient so-called republics were aware of this  and they necessarily slipped into absolute despotism which  of all despotisms  is most endurable under the sovereignty of one individual.  second definitive article of perpetual peace  ii. “the law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states.”  nations  as states  may be judged like individuals who  living in the natural state of society that is to say  uncontrolled by external law injure one another through their very proximity. every state  for the sake of its own security  may and ought to demand that its neighbour should submit itself to conditions  similar to those of the civil society where the right of every individual is guaranteed. this would give rise to a federation of nations which  however  would not have to be a state of nations. that would involve a contradiction. for the term “state” implies the relation of one who rules to those who obey that is to say  of law-giver to the subject people: and many nations in one state would constitute only one nation  which contradicts our hypothesis  since here we have to consider the right of one nation against another  in so far as they are so many separate states and are not to be fused into one.  the attachment of savages to their lawless liberty  the fact that they would rather be at hopeless variance with one another than submit themselves to a legal authority constituted by themselves  that they therefore prefer their senseless freedom to a reason-governed liberty  is regarded by us with profound contempt as barbarism and uncivilisation and the brutal degradation of humanity. so one would think that civilised races  each formed into a state by itself  must come out of such an abandoned condition as soon as they possibly can. on the contrary  however  every state thinks rather that its majesty (the “majesty” of a people is an absurd expression) lies just in the very fact that it is subject to no external legal authority; and the glory of the ruler consists in this  that  without his requiring to expose himself to danger  thousands stand at his command ready to let themselves be sacrificed for a matter of no concern to them. the difference between the savages of europe and those of america lies chiefly in this  that  while many tribes of the latter have been entirely devoured by their enemies  europeans know a better way of using the vanquished than by eating them; and they prefer to increase through them the number of their subjects  and so the number of instruments at their command for still more widely spread war.  the depravity of human nature shows itself without disguise in the unrestrained relations of nations to each other  while in the law-governed civil state much of this is hidden by the check of government. this being so  it is astonishing that the word “right” has not yet been entirely banished from the politics of war as pedantic  and that no state has yet ventured to publicly advocate this point of view. for hugo grotius  puffendorf  vattel and others job’s comforters  all of them are always quoted in good faith to justify an attack  although their codes  whether couched in philosophical or diplomatic terms  have not nor can have the slightest legal force  because states  as such  are under no common external authority; and there is no instance of a state having ever been moved by argument to desist from its purpose  even when this was backed up by the testimony of such great men. this homage which every state renders in words at least to the idea of right  proves that  although it may be slumbering  there is  notwithstanding  to be found in man a still higher natural moral capacity by the aid of which he will in time gain the mastery over the evil principle in his nature  the existence of which he is unable to deny. and he hopes the same of others; for otherwise the word “right” would never be uttered by states who wish to wage war  unless to deride it like the gallic prince who declared: “the privilege which nature gives the strong is that the weak must obey them.”  the method by which states prosecute their rights can never be by process of law as it is where there is an external tribunal but only by war. through this means  however  and its favourable issue  victory  the question of right is never decided. a treaty of peace makes  it may be  an end to the war of the moment  but not to the conditions of war which at any time may afford a new pretext for opening hostilities; and this we cannot exactly condemn as unjust  because under these conditions everyone is his own judge. notwithstanding  not quite the same rule applies to states according to the law of nations as holds good of individuals in a lawless condition according to the law of nature  namely  “that they ought to advance out of this condition.” this is so  because  as states  they have already within themselves a legal constitution  and have therefore advanced beyond the stage at which others  in accordance with their ideas of right  can force them to come under a wider legal constitution. meanwhile  however  reason  from her throne of the supreme law-giving moral power  absolutely condemns war as a morally lawful proceeding  and makes a state of peace  on the other hand  an immediate duty. without a compact between the nations  however  this state of peace cannot be established or assured. hence there must be an alliance of a particular kind which we may call a covenant of peace (foedus pacificum)  which would differ from a treaty of peace (pactum pacis) in this respect  that the latter merely puts an end to one war  while the former would seek to put an end to war for ever. this alliance does not aim at the gain of any power whatsoever of the state  but merely at the preservation and security of the freedom of the state for itself and of other allied states at the same time. the latter do not  however  require  for this reason  to submit themselves like individuals in the state of nature to public laws and coercion. the practicability or objective reality of this idea of federation which is to extend gradually over all states and so lead to perpetual peace can be shewn. for  if fortune ordains that a powerful and enlightened people should form a republic  which by its very nature is inclined to perpetual peace this would serve as a centre of federal union for other states wishing to join  and thus secure conditions of freedom among the states in accordance with the idea of the law of nations. gradually  through different unions of this kind  the federation would extend further and further.  it is quite comprehensible that a people should say: “there shall be no war among us  for we shall form ourselves into a state  that is to say  constitute for ourselves a supreme legislative  administrative and judicial power which will settle our disputes peaceably.” but if this state says: “there shall be no war between me and other states  although i recognise no supreme law-giving power which will secure me my rights and whose rights i will guarantee;” then it is not at all clear upon what grounds i could base my confidence in my right  unless it were the substitute for that compact on which civil society is based namely  free federation which reason must necessarily connect with the idea of the law of nations  if indeed any meaning is to be left in that concept at all.  there is no intelligible meaning in the idea of the law of nations as giving a right to make war; for that must be a right to decide what is just  not in accordance with universal  external laws limiting the freedom of each individual  but by means of one-sided maxims applied by force. we must then understand by this that men of such ways of thinking are quite justly served  when they destroy one another  and thus find perpetual peace in the wide grave which covers all the abominations of acts of violence as well as the authors of such deeds. for states  in their relation to one another  there can be  according to reason  no other way of advancing from that lawless condition which unceasing war implies  than by giving up their savage lawless freedom  just as individual men have done  and yielding to the coercion of public laws. thus they can form a state of nations (civitas gentium)  one  too  which will be ever increasing and would finally embrace all the peoples of the earth. states  however  in accordance with their understanding of the law of nations  by no means desire this  and therefore reject in hypothesi what is correct in thesi. hence  instead of the positive idea of a world-republic  if all is not to be lost  only the negative substitute for it  a federation averting war  maintaining its ground and ever extending over the world may stop the current of this tendency to war and shrinking from the control of law. but even then there will be a constant danger that this propensity may break out. “furor impius intus fremit horridus ore cruento.” (virgil.)  third definitive article of perpetual peace  iii. “the rights of men  as citizens of the world  shall be limited to the conditions of universal hospitality.”  we are speaking here  as in the previous articles  not of philanthropy  but of right; and in this sphere hospitality signifies the claim of a stranger entering foreign territory to be treated by its owner without hostility. the latter may send him away again  if this can be done without causing his death; but  so long as he conducts himself peaceably  he must not be treated as an enemy. it is not a right to be treated as a guest to which the stranger can lay claim a special friendly compact on his behalf would be required to make him for a given time an actual inmate but he has a right of visitation. this right to present themselves to society belongs to all mankind in virtue of our common right of possession on the surface of the earth on which  as it is a globe  we cannot be infinitely scattered  and must in the end reconcile ourselves to existence side by side: at the same time  originally no one individual had more right than another to live in any one particular spot. uninhabitable portions of the surface  ocean and desert  split up the human community  but in such a way that ships and camels “the ship of the desert” make it possible for men to come into touch with one another across these unappropriated regions and to take advantage of our common claim to the face of the earth with a view to a possible intercommunication. the inhospitality of the inhabitants of certain sea coasts as  for example  the coast of barbary in plundering ships in neighbouring seas or making slaves of shipwrecked mariners; or the behaviour of the arab bedouins in the deserts  who think that proximity to nomadic tribes constitutes a right to rob  is thus contrary to the law of nature. this right to hospitality  however that is to say  the privilege of strangers arriving on foreign soil does not amount to more than what is implied in a permission to make an attempt at intercourse with the original inhabitants. in this way far distant territories may enter into peaceful relations with one another. these relations may at last come under the public control of law  and thus the human race may be brought nearer the realisation of a cosmopolitan constitution.  let us look now  for the sake of comparison  at the inhospitable behaviour of the civilised nations  especially the commercial states of our continent. the injustice which they exhibit on visiting foreign lands and races this being equivalent in their eyes to conquest is such as to fill us with horror. america  the negro countries  the spice islands  the cape etc. were  on being discovered  looked upon as countries which belonged to nobody; for the native inhabitants were reckoned as nothing. in hindustan  under the pretext of intending to establish merely commercial depots  the europeans introduced foreign troops; and  as a result  the different states of hindustan were stirred up to far-spreading wars. oppression of the natives followed  famine  insurrection  perfidy and all the rest of the litany of evils which can afflict mankind.  china and japan (nipon) which had made an attempt at receiving guests of this kind  have now taken a prudent step. only to a single european people  the dutch  has china given the right of access to her shores (but not of entrance into the country)  while japan has granted both these concessions; but at the same time they exclude the dutch who enter  as if they were prisoners  from social intercourse with the inhabitants. the worst  or from the standpoint of ethical judgment the best  of all this is that no satisfaction is derived from all this violence  that all these trading companies stand on the verge of ruin  that the sugar islands  that seat of the most horrible and deliberate slavery  yield no real profit  but only have their use indirectly and for no very praiseworthy object namely  that of furnishing men to be trained as sailors for the men-of-war and thereby contributing to the carrying on of war in europe. and this has been done by nations who make a great ado about their piety  and who  while they are quite ready to commit injustice  would like  in their orthodoxy  to be considered among the elect.  the intercourse  more or less close  which has been everywhere steadily increasing between the nations of the earth  has now extended so enormously that a violation of right in one part of the world is felt all over it. hence the idea of a cosmopolitan right is no fantastical  high-flown notion of right  but a complement of the unwritten code of law constitutional as well as international law necessary for the public rights of mankind in general and thus for the realisation of perpetual peace. for only by endeavouring to fulfil the conditions laid down by this cosmopolitan law can we flatter ourselves that we are gradually approaching that ideal.   first supplement  concerning the guarantee of perpetual peace  this guarantee is given by no less a power than the great artist nature (natura dædala rerum) in whose mechanical course is clearly exhibited a predetermined design to make harmony spring from human discord  even against the will of man. now this design  although called fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause  the laws of whose operation are unknown to us  is  when considered as the purpose manifested in the course of nature  called providence  as the deep-lying wisdom of a higher cause  directing itself towards the ultimate practical end of the human race and predetermining the course of things with a view to its realisation. this providence we do not  it is true  perceive in the cunning contrivances  of nature; nor can we even conclude from the fact of their existence that it is there; but  as in every relation between the form of things and their final cause  we can  and must  supply the thought of a higher wisdom  in order that we may be able to form an idea of the possible existence of these products after the analogy of human works of art lungen]. the representation to ourselves of the relation and agreement of these formations of nature to the moral purpose for which they were made and which reason directly prescribes to us  is an idea  it is true  which is in theory superfluous; but in practice it is dogmatic  and its objective reality is well established. thus we see  for example  with regard to the ideal  of perpetual peace  that it is our duty to make use of the mechanism of nature for the realisation of that end. moreover  in a case like this where we are interested merely in the theory and not in the religious question  the use of the word “nature” is more appropriate than that of “providence”  in view of the limitations of human reason  which  in considering the relation of effects to their causes  must keep within the limits of possible experience. and the term “nature” is also less presumptuous than the other. to speak of a providence knowable by us would be boldly to put on the wings of icarus in order to draw near to the mystery of its unfathomable purpose.  before we determine the surety given by nature more exactly  we must first look at what ultimately makes this guarantee of peace necessary the circumstances in which nature has carefully placed the actors in her great theatre. in the next place  we shall proceed to consider the manner in which she gives this surety.  the provisions she has made are as follow: (1) she has taken care that men can live in all parts of the world; (2) she has scattered them by means of war in all directions  even into the most inhospitable regions  so that these too might be populated; (3) by this very means she has forced them to enter into relations more or less controlled by law. it is surely wonderful that  on the cold wastes round the arctic ocean  there is always to be found moss for the reindeer to scrape out from under the snow  the reindeer itself either serving as food or to draw the sledge of the ostiak or samoyedes. and salt deserts which would otherwise be left unutilised have the camel  which seems as if created for travelling in such lands. this evidence of design in things  however  is still more clear when we come to know that  besides the fur-clad animals of the shores of the arctic ocean  there are seals  walruses and whales whose flesh furnishes food and whose oil fire for the dwellers in these regions. but the providential care of nature excites our wonder above all  when we hear of the driftwood which is carried whence no one knows to these treeless shores: for without the aid of this material the natives could neither construct their craft  nor weapons  nor huts for shelter. here too they have so much to do  making war against wild animals  that they live at peace with one another. but what drove them originally into these regions was probably nothing but war.  of animals  used by us as instruments of war  the horse was the first which man learned to tame and domesticate during the period of the peopling of the earth; the elephant belongs to the later period of the luxury of states already established. in the same way  the art of cultivating certain grasses called cereals no longer known to us in their original form and also the multiplication and improvement  by transplanting and grafting  of the original kinds of fruit in europe  probably only two species  the crab-apple and wild pear could only originate under the conditions accompanying established states where the rights of property are assured. that is to say it would be after man  hitherto existing in lawless liberty  had advanced beyond the occupations of a hunter  a fisherman or a shepherd to the life of a tiller of the soil  when salt and iron were discovered  to become  perhaps  the first articles of commerce between different peoples  and were sought far and near. in this way the peoples would be at first brought into peaceful relation with one another  and so come to an understanding and the enjoyment of friendly intercourse  even with their most distant neighbours.  now while nature provided that men could live on all parts of the earth  she also at the same time despotically willed that they should live everywhere on it  although against their own inclination and even although this imperative did not presuppose an idea of duty which would compel obedience to nature with the force of a moral law. but  to attain this end  she has chosen war. so we see certain peoples  widely separated  whose common descent is made evident by affinity in their languages. thus  for instance  we find the samoyedes on the arctic ocean  and again a people speaking a similar language on the altai mts.  200 miles  off  between whom has pressed in a mounted tribe  warlike in character and of mongolian origin  which has driven one branch of the race far from the other  into the most inhospitable regions where their own inclination would certainly not have carried them. in the same way  through the intrusion of the gothic and sarmatian tribes  the finns in the most northerly regions of europe  whom we call laplanders  have been separated by as great a distance from the hungarians  with whose language their own is allied. and what but war can have brought the esquimos to the north of america  a race quite distinct from those of that country and probably european adventurers of prehistoric times? and war too  nature’s method of populating the earth  must have driven the pescherais in south america as far as patagonia. war itself  however  is in need of no special stimulating cause  but seems engrafted in human nature  and is even regarded as something noble in itself to which man is inspired by the love of glory apart from motives of self-interest. hence  among the savages of america as well as those of europe in the age of chivalry  martial courage is looked upon as of great value itself  not merely when a war is going on  as is reasonable enough  but in order that there should be war: and thus war is often entered upon merely to exhibit this quality. so that an intrinsic dignity is held to attach to war in itself  and even philosophers eulogise it as an ennobling  refining influence on humanity  unmindful of the greek proverb  “war is evil  in so far as it makes more bad people than it takes away.”  so much  then  of what nature does for her own ends with regard to the human race as members of the animal world. now comes the question which touches the essential points in this design of a perpetual peace: “what does nature do in this respect with reference to the end which man’s own reason sets before him as a duty? and consequently what does she do to further the realisation of his moral purpose? how does she guarantee that what man  by the laws of freedom  ought to do and yet fails to do  he will do  without any infringement of his freedom by the compulsion of nature and that  moreover  this shall be done in accordance with the three forms of public right constitutional or political law  international law and cosmopolitan law?” when i say of nature that she wills that this or that should take place  i do not mean that she imposes upon us the duty to do it for only the free  unrestrained  practical reason can do that but that she does it herself  whether we will or not. “fata volentem ducunt  nolentem trahunt.”  1. even if a people were not compelled through internal discord to submit to the restraint of public laws  war would bring this about  working from without. for  according to the contrivance of nature which we have mentioned  every people finds another tribe in its neighbourhood  pressing upon it in such a manner that it is compelled to form itself internally into a state to be able to defend itself as a power should. now the republican constitution is the only one which is perfectly adapted to the rights of man  but it is also the most difficult to establish and still more to maintain. so generally is this recognised that people often say the members of a republican state would require to be angels  because men  with their self-seeking propensities  are not fit for a constitution of so sublime a form. but now nature comes to the aid of the universal  reason-derived will which  much as we honour it  is in practice powerless. and this she does  by means of these very self-seeking propensities  so that it only depends and so much lies within the power of man on a good organisation of the state for their forces to be so pitted against one another  that the one may check the destructive activity of the other or neutralise its effect. and hence  from the standpoint of reason  the result will be the same as if both forces did not exist  and each individual is compelled to be  if not a morally good man  yet at least a good citizen. the problem of the formation of the state  hard as it may sound  is not insoluble  even for a race of devils  granted that they have intelligence. it may be put thus: “given a multitude of rational beings who  in a body  require general laws for their own preservation  but each of whom  as an individual  is secretly inclined to exempt himself from this restraint: how are we to order their affairs and how establish for them a constitution such that  although their private dispositions may be really antagonistic  they may yet so act as a check upon one another  that  in their public relations  the effect is the same as if they had no such evil sentiments.” such a problem must be capable of solution. for it deals  not with the moral reformation of mankind  but only with the mechanism of nature; and the problem is to learn how this mechanism of nature can be applied to men  in order so to regulate the antagonism of conflicting interests in a people that they may even compel one another to submit to compulsory laws and thus necessarily bring about the state of peace in which laws have force. we can see  in states actually existing  although very imperfectly organised  that  in externals  they already approximate very nearly to what the idea of right prescribes  although the principle of morality is certainly not the cause. a good political constitution  however  is not to be expected as a result of progress in morality; but rather  conversely  the good moral condition of a nation is to be looked for  as one of the first fruits of such a constitution. hence the mechanism of nature  working through the self-seeking propensities of man (which of course counteract one another in their external effects)  may be used by reason as a means of making way for the realisation of her own purpose  the empire of right  and  as far as is in the power of the state  to promote and secure in this way internal as well as external peace. we may say  then  that it is the irresistible will of nature that right shall at last get the supremacy. what one here fails to do will be accomplished in the long run  although perhaps with much inconvenience to us. as bouterwek says  “if you bend the reed too much it breaks: he who would do too much does nothing.”  2. the idea of international law presupposes the separate existence of a number of neighbouring and independent states; and  although such a condition of things is in itself already a state of war  (if a federative union of these nations does not prevent the outbreak of hostilities) yet  according to the idea of reason  this is better than that all the states should be merged into one under a power which has gained the ascendency over its neighbours and gradually become a universal monarchy. for the wider the sphere of their jurisdiction  the more laws lose in force; and soulless despotism  when it has choked the seeds of good  at last sinks into anarchy. nevertheless it is the desire of every state  or of its ruler  to attain to a permanent condition of peace in this very way; that is to say  by subjecting the whole world as far as possible to its sway. but nature wills it otherwise. she employs two means to separate nations  and prevent them from intermixing: namely  the differences of language and of religion. these differences bring with them a tendency to mutual hatred  and furnish pretexts for waging war. but  none the less  with the growth of culture and the gradual advance of men to greater unanimity of principle  they lead to concord in a state of peace which  unlike the despotism we have spoken of  (the churchyard of freedom) does not arise from the weakening of all forces  but is brought into being and secured through the equilibrium of these forces in their most active rivalry.  3. as nature wisely separates nations which the will of each state  sanctioned even by the principles of international law  would gladly unite under its own sway by stratagem or force; in the same way  on the other hand  she unites nations whom the principle of a cosmopolitan right would not have secured against violence and war. and this union she brings about through an appeal to their mutual interests. the commercial spirit cannot co-exist with war  and sooner or later it takes possession of every nation. for  of all the forces which lie at the command of a state  the power of money is probably the most reliable. hence states find themselves compelled not  it is true  exactly from motives of morality to further the noble end of peace and to avert war  by means of mediation  wherever it threatens to break out  just as if they had made a permanent league for this purpose. for great alliances with a view to war can  from the nature of things  only very rarely occur  and still more seldom succeed.  in this way nature guarantees the coming of perpetual peace  through the natural course of human propensities: not indeed with sufficient certainty to enable us to prophesy the future of this ideal theoretically  but yet clearly enough for practical purposes. and thus this guarantee of nature makes it a duty that we should labour for this end  an end which is no mere chimera.   second supplement  a secret article for perpetual peace  a secret article in negotiations concerning public right is  when looked at objectively or with regard to the meaning of the term  a contradiction. when we view it  however  from the subjective standpoint  with regard to the character and condition of the person who dictates it  we see that it might quite well involve some private consideration  so that he would regard it as hazardous to his dignity to acknowledge such an article as originating from him.  the only article of this kind is contained in the following proposition: “the opinions of philosophers  with regard to the conditions of the possibility of a public peace  shall be taken into consideration by states armed for war.”  it seems  however  to be derogatory to the dignity of the legislative authority of a state to which we must of course attribute all wisdom to ask advice from subjects (among whom stand philosophers) about the rules of its behaviour to other states. at the same time  it is very advisable that this should be done. hence the state will silently invite suggestion for this purpose  while at the same time keeping the fact secret. this amounts to saying that the state will allow philosophers to discuss freely and publicly the universal principles governing the conduct of war and establishment of peace; for they will do this of their own accord  if no prohibition is laid upon them. the arrangement between states  on this point  does not require that a special agreement should be made  merely for this purpose; for it is already involved in the obligation imposed by the universal reason of man which gives the moral law. we would not be understood to say that the state must give a preference to the principles of the philosopher  rather than to the opinions of the jurist  the representative of state authority; but only that he should be heard. the latter  who has chosen for a symbol the scales of right and the sword of justice  generally uses that sword not merely to keep off all outside influences from the scales; for  when one pan of the balance will not go down  he throws his sword into it; and then væ victis! the jurist  not being a moral philosopher  is under the greatest temptation to do this  because it is his business only to apply existing laws and not to investigate whether these are not themselves in need of improvement; and this actually lower function of his profession he looks upon as the nobler  because it is linked to power (as is the case also in both the other faculties  theology and medicine). philosophy occupies a very low position compared with this combined power. so that it is said  for example  that she is the handmaid of theology; and the same has been said of her position with regard to law and medicine. it is not quite clear  however  “whether she bears the torch before these gracious ladies  or carries the train.”  that kings should philosophise  or philosophers become kings  is not to be expected. but neither is it to be desired; for the possession of power is inevitably fatal to the free exercise of reason. but it is absolutely indispensable  for their enlightenment as to the full significance of their vocations  that both kings and sovereign nations  which rule themselves in accordance with laws of equality  should not allow the class of philosophers to disappear  nor forbid the expression of their opinions  but should allow them to speak openly. and since this class of men  by their very nature  are incapable of instigating rebellion or forming unions for purposes of political agitation  they should not be suspected of propagandism.   appendix i  on the disagreement between morals and politics with reference to perpetual peace  in an objective sense  morals is a practical science  as the sum of laws exacting unconditional obedience  in accordance with which we ought to act. now  once we have admitted the authority of this idea of duty  it is evidently inconsistent that we should think of saying that we cannot act thus. for  in this case  the idea of duty falls to the ground of itself; “ultra posse nemo obligatur.” hence there can be no quarrel between politics  as the practical science of right  and morals  which is also a science of right  but theoretical. that is  theory cannot come into conflict with practice. for  in that case  we would need to understand under the term “ethics” or “morals” a universal doctrine of expediency  or  in other words  a theory of precepts which may guide us in choosing the best means for attaining ends calculated for our advantage. this is to deny that a science of morals exists.    politics says  “be wise as serpents”; morals adds the limiting condition  “and guileless as doves.” if these precepts cannot stand together in one command  then there is a real quarrel between politics and morals. but if they can be completely brought into accord  then the idea of any antagonism between them is absurd  and the question of how best to make a compromise between the two points of view ceases to be even raised. although the saying  “honesty is the best policy ” expresses a theory which  alas  is often contradicted in practice  yet the likewise theoretical maxim  “honesty is better than any policy ” is exalted high above every possible objection  is indeed the necessary condition of all politics.  the terminus of morals does not yield to jupiter  the terminus of force; for the latter remains beneath the sway of fate. in other words  reason is not sufficiently enlightened to survey the series of predetermining causes which would make it possible for us to predict with certainty the good or bad results of human action  as they follow from the mechanical laws of nature; although we may hope that things will turn out as we should desire. but what we have to do  in order to remain in the path of duty guided by the rules of wisdom  reason makes everywhere perfectly clear  and does this for the purpose of furthering her ultimate ends.  the practical man  however  for whom morals is mere theory  even while admitting that what ought to be can be  bases his dreary verdict against our well-meant hopes really on this: he pretends that he can foresee from his observation of human nature  that men will never be willing to do what is required in order to bring about the wished-for results leading to perpetual peace. it is true that the will of all individual men to live under a legal constitution according to the principles of liberty that is to say  the distributive unity of the wills of all is not sufficient to attain this end. we must have the collective unity of their united will: all as a body must determine these new conditions. the solution of this difficult problem is required in order that civil society should be a whole. to all this diversity of individual wills there must come a uniting cause  in order to produce a common will which no distributive will is able to give. hence  in the practical realisation of that idea  no other beginning of a law-governed society can be counted upon than one that is brought about by force: upon this force  too  public law afterwards rests. this state of things certainly prepares us to meet considerable deviation in actual experience from the theoretical idea of perpetual peace  since we cannot take into account the moral character and disposition of a law-giver in this connection  or expect that  after he has united a wild multitude into one people  he will leave it to them to bring about a legal constitution by their common will.  it amounts to this. any ruler who has once got the power in his hands will not let the people dictate laws for him. a state which enjoys an independence of the control of external law will not submit to the judgment of the tribunals of other states  when it has to consider how to obtain its rights against them. and even a continent  when it feels its superiority to another  whether this be in its way or not  will not fail to take advantage of an opportunity offered of strengthening its power by the spoliation or even conquest of this territory. hence all theoretical schemes  connected with constitutional  international or cosmopolitan law  crumble away into empty impracticable ideals. while  on the other hand  a practical science  based on the empirical principles of human nature  which does not disdain to model its maxims on an observation of actual life  can alone hope to find a sure foundation on which to build up a system of national policy.  now certainly  if there is neither freedom nor a moral law founded upon it  and every actual or possible event happens in the mere mechanical course of nature  then politics  as the art of making use of this physical necessity in things for the government of men  is the whole of practical wisdom and the idea of right is an empty concept. if  on the other hand  we find that this idea of right is necessarily to be conjoined with politics and even to be raised to the position of a limiting condition of that science  then the possibility of reconciling them must be admitted. i can thus imagine a moral politician  that is to say  one who understands the principles of statesmanship to be such as do not conflict with morals; but i cannot conceive of a political moralist who fashions for himself such a system of ethics as may serve the interest of statesmen.  the moral politician will always act upon the following principle: “if certain defects which could not have been avoided are found in the political constitution or foreign relations of a state  it is a duty for all  especially for the rulers of the state  to apply their whole energy to correcting them as soon as possible  and to bringing the constitution and political relations on these points into conformity with the law of nature  as it is held up as a model before us in the idea of reason; and this they should do even at a sacrifice of their own interest.” now it is contrary to all politics which is  in this particular  in agreement with morals to dissever any of the links binding citizens together in the state or nations in cosmopolitan union  before a better constitution is there to take the place of what has been thus destroyed. and hence it would be absurd indeed to demand that every imperfection in political matters must be violently altered on the spot. but  at the same time  it may be required of a ruler at least that he should earnestly keep the maxim in mind which points to the necessity of such a change; so that he may go on constantly approaching the end to be realised  namely  the best possible constitution according to the laws of right. even although it is still under despotic rule  in accordance with its constitution as then existing  a state may govern itself on republican lines  until the people gradually become capable of being influenced by the mere idea of the authority of law  just as if it had physical power. and they become accordingly capable of self-legislation  their faculty for which is founded on original right. but if  through the violence of revolution  the product of a bad government  a constitution more in accord with the spirit of law were attained even by unlawful means  it should no longer be held justifiable to bring the people back to the old constitution  although  while the revolution was going on  every one who took part in it by use of force or stratagem  may have been justly punished as a rebel. as regards the external relations of nations  a state cannot be asked to give up its constitution  even although that be a despotism (which is  at the same time  the strongest constitution where foreign enemies are concerned)  so long as it runs the risk of being immediately swallowed up by other states. hence  when such a proposal is made  the state whose constitution is in question must at least be allowed to defer acting upon it until a more convenient time.    it is always possible that moralists who rule despotically  and are at a loss in practical matters  will come into collision with the rules of political wisdom in many ways  by adopting measures without sufficient deliberation which show themselves afterwards to have been overestimated. when they thus offend against nature  experience must gradually lead them into a better track. but  instead of this being the case  politicians who are fond of moralising do all they can to make moral improvement impossible and to perpetuate violations of law  by extenuating political principles which are antagonistic to the idea of right  on the pretext that human nature is not capable of good  in the sense of the ideal which reason prescribes.  these politicians  instead of adopting an open  straightforward way of doing things (as they boast)  mix themselves up in intrigue. they get at the authorities in power and say what will please them; their sole bent is to sacrifice the nation  or even  if they can  the whole world  with the one end in view that their own private interest may be forwarded. this is the manner of regular jurists (i mean the journeyman lawyer not the legislator)  when they aspire to politics. for  as it is not their business to reason too nicely over legislation  but only to enforce the laws of the country  every legal constitution in its existing form and  when this is changed by the proper authorities  the one which takes its place  will always seem to them the best possible. and the consequence is that everything is purely mechanical. but this adroitness in suiting themselves to any circumstances may lead them to the delusion that they are also capable of giving an opinion about the principles of political constitutions in general  in so far as they conform to ideas of right  and are therefore not empirical  but a priori. and they may therefore brag about their knowledge of men  which indeed one expects to find  since they have to deal with so many without really knowing the nature of man and what can be made of it  to gain which knowledge a higher standpoint of anthropological observation than theirs is required. filled with ideas of this kind  if they trespass outside their own sphere on the boundaries of political and international law  looked upon as ideals which reason holds before us  they can do so only in the spirit of chicanery. for they will follow their usual method of making everything conform mechanically to compulsory laws despotically made and enforced  even here  where the ideas of reason recognise the validity of a legal compulsory force  only when it is in accordance with the principles of freedom through which a permanently valid constitution becomes first of all possible. the would-be practical man  leaving out of account this idea of reason  thinks that he can solve this problem empirically by looking to the way in which those constitutions which have best survived the test of time were established  even although the spirit of these may have been generally contrary to the idea of right. the principles which he makes use of here  although indeed he does not make them public  amount pretty much to the following sophistical maxims.  1. fac et excusa. seize the most favourable opportunity for arbitrary usurpation either of the authority of the state over its own people or over a neighbouring people; the justification of the act and extenuation of the use of force will come much more easily and gracefully  when the deed is done  than if one has to think out convincing reasons for taking this step and first hear through all the objections which can be made against it. this is especially true in the first case mentioned  where the supreme power in the state also controls the legislature which we must obey without any reasoning about it. besides  this show of audacity in a statesman even lends him a certain semblance of inward conviction of the justice of his action; and once he has got so far the god of success (bonus eventus) is his best advocate.  2. si fecisti  nega. as for any crime you have committed  such as has  for instance  brought your people to despair and thence to insurrection  deny that it has happened owing to any fault of yours. say rather that it is all caused by the insubordination of your subjects  or  in the case of your having usurped a neighbouring state  that human nature is to blame; for  if a man is not ready to use force and steal a march upon his neighbour  he may certainly count on the latter forestalling him and taking him prisoner.  3. divide et impera. that is to say  if there are certain privileged persons  holding authority among the people  who have merely chosen you for their sovereign as primus inter pares  bring about a quarrel among them  and make mischief between them and the people. now back up the people with a dazzling promise of greater freedom; everything will now depend unconditionally on your will. or again  if there is a difficulty with foreign states  then to stir up dissension among them is a pretty sure means of subjecting first one and then the other to your sway  under the pretext of aiding the weaker.  it is true that now-a-days no body is taken in by these political maxims  for they are all familiar to everyone. moreover  there is no need of being ashamed of them  as if their injustice were too patent. for the great powers never feel shame before the judgment of the common herd  but only before one another; so that as far as this matter goes  it is not the revelation of these guiding principles of policy that can make rulers ashamed  but only the unsuccessful use of them. for as to the morality of these maxims  politicians are all agreed. hence there is always left political prestige on which they can safely count; and this means the glory of increasing their power by any means that offer.             in all these twistings and turnings of an immoral doctrine of expediency which aims at substituting a state of peace for the warlike conditions in which men are placed by nature  so much at least is clear; that men cannot get away from the idea of right in their private any more than in their public relations; and that they do not dare (this is indeed most strikingly seen in the concept of an international law) to base politics merely on the manipulations of expediency and therefore to refuse all obedience to the idea of a public right. on the contrary  they pay all fitting honour to the idea of right in itself  even although they should  at the same time  devise a hundred subterfuges and excuses to avoid it in practice  and should regard force  backed up by cunning  as having the authority which comes from being the source and unifying principle of all right. it will be well to put an end to this sophistry  if not to the injustice it extenuates  and to bring the false advocates of the mighty of the earth to confess that it is not right but might in whose interest they speak  and that it is the worship of might from which they take their cue  as if in this matter they had a right to command. in order to do this  we must first expose the delusion by which they deceive themselves and others; then discover the ultimate principle from which their plans for a perpetual peace proceed; and thence show that all the evil which stands in the way of the realisation of that ideal springs from the fact that the political moralist begins where the moral politician rightly ends and that  by subordinating principles to an end or putting the cart before the horse  he defeats his intention of bringing politics into harmony with morals.  in order to make practical philosophy consistent with itself  we must first decide the following question: in dealing with the problems of practical reason must we begin from its material principle the end as the object of free choice or from its formal principle which is based merely on freedom in its external relation? from which comes the following law: “act so that thou canst will that thy maxim should be a universal law  be the end of thy action what it will.”  without doubt  the latter determining principle of action must stand first; for  as a principle of right  it carries unconditional necessity with it  whereas the former is obligatory only if we assume the empirical conditions of the end set before us  that is to say  that it is an end capable of being practically realised. and if this end as  for example  the end of perpetual peace should be also a duty  this same duty must necessarily have been deduced from the formal principle governing the maxims which guide external action. now the first principle is the principle of the political moralist; the problems of constitutional  international and cosmopolitan law are mere technical problems (problema technicum). the second or formal principle  on the other hand  as the principle of the moral politician who regards it as a moral problem (problema morale)  differs widely from the other principle in its methods of bringing about perpetual peace  which we desire not only as a material good  but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of the precepts of duty.  to solve the first problem that  namely  of political expediency much knowledge of nature is required  that her mechanical laws may be employed for the end in view. and yet the result of all knowledge of this kind is uncertain  as far as perpetual peace is concerned. this we find to be so  whichever of the three departments of public law we take. it is uncertain whether a people could be better kept in obedience and at the same time prosperity by severity or by baits held out to their vanity; whether they would be better governed under the sovereignty of a single individual or by the authority of several acting together; whether the combined authority might be better secured merely  say  by an official nobility or by the power of the people within the state; and  finally  whether such conditions could be long maintained. there are examples to the contrary in history in the case of all forms of government  with the exception of the only true republican constitution  the idea of which can occur only to a moral politician. still more uncertain is a law of nations  ostensibly established upon statutes devised by ministers; for this amounts in fact to mere empty words  and rests on treaties which  in the very act of ratification  contain a secret reservation of the right to violate them. on the other hand  the solution of the second problem the problem of political wisdom forces itself  we may say  upon us; it is quite obvious to every one  and puts all crooked dealings to shame; it leads  too  straight to the desired end  while at the same time  discretion warns us not to drag in the conditions of perpetual peace by force  but to take time and approach this ideal gradually as favourable circumstances permit.  this may be expressed in the following maxim: “seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason and its righteousness  and the object of your endeavour  the blessing of perpetual peace  will be added unto you.” for the science of morals generally has this peculiarity  and it has it also with regard to the moral principles of public law  and therefore with regard to a science of politics knowable a priori  that the less it makes a man’s conduct depend on the end he has set before him  his purposed material or moral gain  so much the more  nevertheless  does it conform in general to this end. the reason for this is that it is just the universal will  given a priori  which exists in a people or in the relation of different peoples to one another  that alone determines what is lawful among men. this union of individual wills  however  if we proceed consistently in practice  in observance of the mechanical laws of nature  may be at the same time the cause of bringing about the result intended and practically realizing the idea of right. hence it is  for example  a principle of moral politics that a people should unite into a state according to the only valid concepts of right  the ideas of freedom and equality; and this principle is not based on expediency  but upon duty. political moralists  however  do not deserve a hearing  much and sophistically as they may reason about the existence  in a multitude of men forming a society  of certain natural tendencies which would weaken those principles and defeat their intention. they may endeavour to prove their assertion by giving instances of badly organised constitutions  chosen both from ancient and modern times  (as  for example  democracies without a representative system); but such arguments are to be treated with contempt  all the more  because a pernicious theory of this kind may perhaps even bring about the evil which it prophesies. for  in accordance with such reasoning  man is thrown into a class with all other living machines which only require the consciousness that they are not free creatures to make them in their own judgment the most miserable of all beings.  fiat justitia  pereat mundus. this saying has become proverbial  and although it savours a little of boastfulness  is also true. we may translate it thus: “let justice rule on earth  although all the rogues in the world should go to the bottom.” it is a good  honest principle of right cutting off all the crooked ways made by knavery or violence. it must not  however  be misunderstood as allowing anyone to exercise his own rights with the utmost severity  a course in contradiction to our moral duty; but we must take it to signify an obligation  binding upon rulers  to refrain from refusing to yield anyone his rights or from curtailing them  out of personal feeling or sympathy for others. for this end  in particular  we require  firstly  that a state should have an internal political constitution  established according to the pure principles of right; secondly  that a union should be formed between this state and neighbouring or distant nations for a legal settlement of their differences  after the analogy of the universal state. this proposition means nothing more than this: political maxims must not start from the idea of a prosperity and happiness which are to be expected from observance of such precepts in every state; that is  not from the end which each nation makes the object of its will as the highest empirical principle of political wisdom; but they must set out from the pure concept of the duty of right  from the “ought” whose principle is given a priori through pure reason. this is the law  whatever the material consequences may be. the world will certainly not perish by any means  because the number of wicked people in it is becoming fewer. the morally bad has one peculiarity  inseparable from its nature; in its purposes  especially in relation to other evil influences  it is in contradiction with itself  and counteracts its own natural effect  and thus makes room for the moral principle of good  although advance in this direction may be slow.  hence objectively  in theory  there is no quarrel between morals and politics. but subjectively  in the self-seeking tendencies of men (which we cannot actually call their morality  as we would a course of action based on maxims of reason ) this disagreement in principle exists and may always survive; for it serves as a whetstone to virtue. according to the principle  tu ne cede malis  sed contra audentior ito  the true courage of virtue in the present case lies not so much in facing the evils and self-sacrifices which must be met here as in firmly confronting the evil principle in our own nature and conquering its wiles. for this is a principle far more dangerous  false  treacherous and sophistical which puts forward the weakness in human nature as a justification for every transgression.  in fact the political moralist may say that a ruler and people  or nation and nation do one another no wrong  when they enter on a war with violence or cunning  although they do wrong  generally speaking  in refusing to respect the idea of right which alone could establish peace for all time. for  as both are equally wrongly disposed to one another  each transgressing the duty he owes to his neighbour  they are both quite rightly served  when they are thus destroyed in war. this mutual destruction stops short at the point of extermination  so that there are always enough of the race left to keep this game going on through all the ages  and a far-off posterity may take warning by them. the providence that orders the course of the world is hereby justified. for the moral principle in mankind never becomes extinguished  and human reason  fitted for the practical realisation of ideas of right according to that principle  grows continually in fitness for that purpose with the ever advancing march of culture; while at the same time  it must be said  the guilt of transgression increases as well. but it seems that  by no theodicy or vindication of the justice of god  can we justify creation in putting such a race of corrupt creatures into the world at all  if  that is  we assume that the human race neither will nor can ever be in a happier condition than it is now. this standpoint  however  is too high a one for us to judge from  or to theorise  with the limited concepts we have at our command  about the wisdom of that supreme power which is unknowable by us. we are inevitably driven to such despairing conclusions as these  if we do not admit that the pure principles of right have objective reality that is to say  are capable of being practically realised and consequently that action must be taken on the part of the people of a state and  further  by states in relation to one another  whatever arguments empirical politics may bring forward against this course. politics in the real sense cannot take a step forward without first paying homage to the principles of morals. and  although politics  per se  is a difficult art  in its union with morals no art is required; for in the case of a conflict arising between the two sciences  the moralist can cut asunder the knot which politics is unable to untie. right must be held sacred by man  however great the cost and sacrifice to the ruling power. here is no half-and-half course. we cannot devise a happy medium between right and expediency  a right pragmatically conditioned. but all politics must bend the knee to the principle of right  and may  in that way  hope to reach  although slowly perhaps  a level whence it may shine upon men for all time.   appendix ii  concerning the harmony of politics with morals according to the transcendental idea of public right  if i look at public right from the point of view of most professors of law  and abstract from its matter or its empirical elements  varying according to the circumstances given in our experience of individuals in a state or of states among themselves  then there remains the form of publicity. the possibility of this publicity  every legal title implies. for without it there could be no justice  which can only be thought as before the eyes of men; and  without justice  there would be no right  for  from justice only  right can come.  this characteristic of publicity must belong to every legal title. hence  as  in any particular case that occurs  there is no difficulty in deciding whether this essential attribute is present or not  (whether  that is  it is reconcilable with the principles of the agent or not)  it furnishes an easily applied criterion which is to be found a priori in the reason  so that in the particular case we can at once recognise the falsity or illegality of a proposed claim (praetensio juris)  as it were by an experiment of pure reason.  having thus  as it were  abstracted from all the empirical elements contained in the concept of a political and international law  such as  for instance  the evil tendency in human nature which makes compulsion necessary  we may give the following proposition as the transcendental formula of public right: “all actions relating to the rights of other men are wrong  if the maxims from which they follow are inconsistent with publicity.”  this principle must be regarded not merely as ethical  as belonging to the doctrine of virtue  but also as juridical  referring to the rights of men. for there is something wrong in a maxim of conduct which i cannot divulge without at once defeating my purpose  a maxim which must therefore be kept secret  if it is to succeed  and which i could not publicly acknowledge without infallibly stirring up the opposition of everyone. this necessary and universal resistance with which everyone meets me  a resistance therefore evident a priori  can be due to no other cause than the injustice with which such a maxim threatens everyone. further  this testing principle is merely negative; that is  it serves only as a means by which we may know when an action is unjust to others. like axioms  it has a certainty incapable of demonstration; it is besides easy of application as appears from the following examples of public right.  1. constitutional law. let us take in the first place the public law of the state (jus civitatis)  particularly in its application to matters within the state. here a question arises which many think difficult to answer  but which the transcendental principle of publicity solves quite readily: “is revolution a legitimate means for a people to adopt  for the purpose of throwing off the oppressive yoke of a so-called tyrant (non titulo  sed exercitio talis)?” the rights of a nation are violated in a government of this kind  and no wrong is done to the tyrant in dethroning him. of this there is no doubt. none the less  it is in the highest degree wrong of the subjects to prosecute their rights in this way; and they would be just as little justified in complaining  if they happened to be defeated in their attempt and had to endure the severest punishment in consequence.  a great many reasons for and against both sides of this question may be given  if we seek to settle it by a dogmatic deduction of the principles of right. but the transcendental principle of the publicity of public right can spare itself this diffuse argumentation. for  according to that principle  the people would ask themselves  before the civil contract was made  whether they could venture to publish maxims  proposing insurrection when a favourable opportunity should present itself. it is quite clear that if  when a constitution is established  it were made a condition that force may be exercised against the sovereign under certain circumstances  the people would be obliged to claim a lawful authority higher than his. but in that case  the so-called sovereign would be no longer sovereign: or  if both powers  that of the sovereign and that of the people  were made a condition of the constitution of the state  then its establishment (which was the aim of the people) would be impossible. the wrongfulness of revolution is quite obvious from the fact that openly to acknowledge maxims which justify this step would make attainment of the end at which they aim impossible. we are obliged to keep them secret. but this secrecy would not be necessary on the part of the head of the state. he may say quite plainly that the ringleaders of every rebellion will be punished by death  even although they may hold that it was he who first transgressed the fundamental law. for  if a ruler is conscious of possessing irresistible sovereign power (and this must be assumed in every civil constitution  because a sovereign who has not power to protect any individual member of the nation against his neighbour has also not the right to exercise authority over him)  then he need have no fear that making known the maxims which guide him will cause the defeat of his plans. and it is quite consistent with this view to hold that  if the people are successful in their insurrection  the sovereign must return to the rank of a subject  and refrain from inciting rebellion with a view to regaining his lost sovereignty. at the same time he need have no fear of being called to account for his former administration.    2. international law. there can be no question of an international law  except on the assumption of some kind of a law-governed state of things  the external condition under which any right can belong to man. for the very idea of international law  as public right  implies the publication of a universal will determining the rights and property of each individual nation; and this status juridicus must spring out of a contract of some sort which may not  like the contract to which the state owes its origin  be founded upon compulsory laws  but may be  at the most  the agreement of a permanent free association such as the federation of the different states  to which we have alluded above. for  without the control of law to some extent  to serve as an active bond of union among different merely natural or moral individuals  that is to say  in a state of nature  there can only be private law. and here we find a disagreement between morals  regarded as the science of right  and politics. the criterion  obtained by observing the effect of publicity on maxims  is just as easily applied  but only when we understand that this agreement binds the contracting states solely with the object that peace may be preserved among them  and between them and other states; in no sense with a view to the acquisition of new territory or power. the following instances of antinomy occur between politics and morals  which are given here with the solution in each case.  a. “when either of these states has promised something to another  (as  for instance  assistance  or a relinquishment of certain territory  or subsidies and such like)  the question may arise whether  in a case where the safety of the state thus bound depends on its evading the fulfilment of this promise  it can do so by maintaining a right to be regarded as a double person: firstly  as sovereign and accountable to no one in the state of which that sovereign power is head; and  secondly  merely as the highest official in the service of that state  who is obliged to answer to the state for every action. and the result of this is that the state is acquitted in its second capacity of any obligation to which it has committed itself in the first.” but  if a nation or its sovereign proclaimed these maxims  the natural consequence would be that every other would flee from it  or unite with other states to oppose such pretensions. and this is a proof that politics  with all its cunning  defeats its own ends  if the test of making principles of action public  which we have indicated  be applied. hence the maxim we have quoted must be wrong.  b. “if a state which has increased its power to a formidable extent (potentia tremenda) excites anxiety in its neighbours  is it right to assume that  since it has the means  it will also have the will to oppress others; and does that give less powerful states a right to unite and attack the greater nation without any definite cause of offence?” a state which would here answer openly in the affirmative would only bring the evil about more surely and speedily. for the greater power would forestall those smaller nations  and their union would be but a weak reed of defence against a state which knew how to apply the maxim  divide et impera. this maxim of political expediency then  when openly acknowledged  necessarily defeats the end at which it aims  and is therefore wrong.  c. “if a smaller state by its geographical position breaks up the territory of a greater  so as to prevent a unity necessary to the preservation of that state  is the latter not justified in subjugating its less powerful neighbour and uniting the territory in question with its own?” we can easily see that the greater state dare not publish such a maxim beforehand; for either all smaller states would without loss of time unite against it  or other powers would contend for this booty. hence the impracticability of such a maxim becomes evident under the light of publicity. and this is a sign that it is wrong  and that in a very great degree; for  although the victim of an act of injustice may be of small account  that does not prevent the injustice done from being very great.  3. cosmopolitan law. we may pass over this department of right in silence  for  owing to its analogy with international law  its maxims are easily specified and estimated.             in this principle of the incompatibility of the maxims of international law with their publicity  we have a good indication of the non-agreement between politics and morals  regarded as a science of right. now we require to know under what conditions these maxims do agree with the law of nations. for we cannot conclude that the converse holds  and that all maxims which can bear publicity are therefore just. for anyone who has a decided supremacy has no need to make any secret about his maxims. the condition of a law of nations being possible at all is that  in the first place  there should be a law-governed state of things. if this is not so  there can be no public right  and all right which we can think of outside the law-governed state  that is to say  in the state of nature  is mere private right. now we have seen above that something of the nature of a federation between nations  for the sole purpose of doing away with war  is the only rightful condition of things reconcilable with their individual freedom. hence the agreement of politics and morals is only possible in a federative union  a union which is necessarily given a priori  according to the principles of right. and the lawful basis of all politics can only be the establishment of this union in its widest possible extent. apart from this end  all political sophistry is folly and veiled injustice. now this sham politics has a casuistry  not to be excelled in the best jesuit school. it has its mental reservation (reservatio mentalis): as in the drawing up of a public treaty in such terms as we can  if we will  interpret when occasion serves to our advantage; for example  the distinction between the status quo in fact (de fait) and in right (de droit). secondly  it has its probabilism; when it pretends to discover evil intentions in another  or makes  the probability of their possible future ascendency a lawful reason for bringing about the destruction of other peaceful states. finally  it has its philosophical sin (peccatum philosophicum  peccatillum  baggatelle) which is that of holding it a trifle easily pardoned that a smaller state should be swallowed up  if this be to the gain of a nation much more powerful; for such an increase in power is supposed to tend to the greater prosperity of the whole world.  duplicity gives politics the advantage of using one branch or the other of morals  just as suits its own ends. the love of our fellowmen is a duty: so too is respect for their rights. but the former is only conditional: the latter  on the other hand  an unconditional  absolutely imperative duty; and anyone who would give himself up to the sweet consciousness of well-doing must be first perfectly assured that he has not transgressed its commands. politics has no difficulty in agreeing with morals in the first sense of the term  as ethics  to secure that men should give to superiors their rights. but when it comes to morals  in its second aspect  as the science of right before which politics must bow the knee  the politician finds it prudent to have nothing to do with compacts and rather to deny all reality to morals in this sense  and reduce all duty to mere benevolence. philosophy could easily frustrate the artifices of a politics like this  which shuns the light of criticism  by publishing its maxims  if only statesmen would have the courage to grant philosophers the right to ventilate their opinions.  with this end in view  i propose another principle of public right  which is at once transcendental and affirmative. its formula would be as follows: “all maxims which require publicity  in order that they may not fail to attain their end  are in agreement both with right and politics.”  for  if these maxims can only attain the end at which they aim by being published  they must be in harmony with the universal end of mankind  which is happiness; and to be in sympathy with this (to make the people contented with their lot) is the real business of politics. now  if this end should be attainable only by publicity  or in other words  through the removal of all distrust of the maxims of politics  these must be in harmony with the right of the people; for a union of the ends of all is only possible in a harmony with this right.  i must postpone the further development and discussion of this principle till another opportunity. that it is a transcendental formula is quite evident from the fact that all the empirical conditions of a doctrine of happiness  or the matter of law  are absent  and that it has regard only to the form of universal conformity to law.             if it is our duty to realise a state of public right  if at the same time there are good grounds for hope that this ideal may be realised  although only by an approximation advancing ad infinitum  then perpetual peace  following hitherto falsely so-called conclusions of peace  which have been in reality mere cessations of hostilities  is no mere empty idea. but rather we have here a problem which gradually works out its own solution and  as the periods in which a given advance takes place towards the realisation of the ideal of perpetual peace will  we hope  become with the passing of time shorter and shorter  we must approach ever nearer to this goal.
